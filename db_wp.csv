<h2>Background</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>This post is a personal reflection in response to a question posed by <a href=""https://twitter.com/TomEduTrainer"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Tom Langston</a> on Twitter as a retweet of <a href=""https://twitter.com/CleggDr"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr Andy Clegg</a>. Observing that other individuals tagged in the tweet have more involvement in policy and management, I was both humbled and interested in why my opinion might be sought. Deliberately I have chosen not to read the answers of others, such as <a href=""https://twitter.com/jamesclay"">@jamesclay</a>'s <a href=""https://elearningstuff.net/2020/06/05/what-have-we-learnt/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">blog post</a>, as I wanted to provide my own perspective. I shall be sure to read that after-the-fact of course and thank you for asking Tom!</p>
<p>To provide some context I have been working as a learning technologist for almost 10 years and my perspective comes from that space: the direct solution space. Although I am occasionally consulted on policy decisions, I am rarely a decision maker and I do not manage people, I do manage systems as a product owner of sorts. In addition to my learning technologist 'hat', I am an accessibility advocate and a trained User Experience researcher. I am passionate about inclusive design, moral transparency and pragmatic teaching and learning.</p>

<h2>Entering lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it became clear that lockdown would be our new reality; decisions had to be made and actioned rapidly. It also became clear that learning technology expertise was a valuable commodity. As a discipline we were suddenly placed at the centre of supporting the continuation of teaching practice, as opposed to our previous position as the grand adviser-integrator-augmenters. I praise my own managers during the lead-up to and final situation of lockdown, who made quick and clear decisions with regard to which tools would be used, and for what tasks in the emergency teaching situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Observations during lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am going to define these as loose observations at this point as I do not yet have the benefit of hindsight. However, I do believe it is important to record your own thinking at a given point in time even if, ultimately circumstances end up proving you wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>The ultimate prioritisation list</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An intense re-focusing meant that we were able to work with a clearly defined technical toolset in an efficient way. We also shifted to a more agile CMS in the interest of getting information out quickly via targetted microsites (Wordpress Blogs). Under normal circumstances the requirement to use standard platforms and administrative processes take precedence, but there was no time for that. As a consequence within a short space of time a relevant, fresh and 'living' set of resources were built to support teaching as it exists right 'now'. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Sharing is caring</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aforementioned set of resources, are out in the world as open educational resources which feels more important than ever in the time of COVID-19. When my Frequently Asked Questions for Microsoft Teams could make a difference for a primary school teacher without a learning technologist - that means a lot to me professionally and personally. This is why I got into this field and over recent years I have noticed a growing tendency for learning technologies information to be squirrelled away. Hopefully this trend may start to wane moving forward. On a technical level, a small but important innovation on our information site was adding the power of ad-free Google search so that the answers to questions could be found more easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Answering the right questions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Referring back to my Frequently Asked Questions, that is not to say that I myself am reinventing the wheel, I am linking to materials which technology vendors such as Microsoft and Blackboard have provided. I already valued these resources which have improved in quantity and quality over recent years. However, a key role of a learning technologist is to know how to contextualise these answers by answering localised questions. Essentially joining up the dots between the question asked, the language used to ask the question, and the language that technology uses to describe itself. So we add grand adviser-integrator-augmenter-<em>translators</em><strong> </strong>to our list. I think now more than ever I value and acknowledge the open resources provided by vendors and other universities across the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>A new conception of time</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the sheer volume of work coming in for a brief time the shape of my job changed. I was in a sort of rapid creation mode during the first three weeks of lockdown. This 'mode' was at turns the most productive and stressful experience of my learning technologies career and was certainly more akin to the adrenaline highs of my previous vocation as a artist and curator; like the feeling of the hours leading up to an opening night. This productivity was supported by a conscious filter where my clients knew I was busy so instead of asking me a question in the first instance, would attempt to find the answer on their own or sought support centrally from a service desk. This was a new situation for me. I like being known as a solutions person, a go-to person, but it suddenly dawned on me that because I am available and take pride in providing a quality service sometimes this means that my own productivity and wellbeing are put on the back-burner. With fewer help calls and more efficient means of answering the questions that were coming in (I'll come to that later), I suddenly had the mental focus I needed to develop two new teaching sessions. I had time free of interruption to think hard about showcasing best practice in the session designs and this was a wonderful feeling. Finally I had some head-space and because I was producing enough work to meet my own self-imposed goals, I got to have lunches away from my desk for the first time in years. <br><br>There is a piece of learning here for me to take away and ruminate on. My role has since reverted back to something more reactive on the day-to-day. However, I am going to consider how I can reach a better state of equilibrium so that I can have blocks of work free of interruption. This tension has always existed in my work, between proactive and reactive, but I do think that in the longer term a project-based workflow more akin to development work, with Agile<sup><a href=""#agile"">1</a></sup> sprints accompanied by service models which support fewer interruptions may be positive. When you are in a service role there can be an intense feeling of guilt when you have taken an hour to work on workshop preparation and have 30 emails - even 'quick' questions at this volume consume work time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Chat is my new best friend</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thinking of those 'quick' questions, I am pleased that HE is finally starting to adopt chat-based tools. I had been using <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/"" target=""_blank"">Slack</a> for User Experience (UX) professional networking for a number of years and looked forward to the day when a similar solution would be part of my Learning <em>Experience</em> work. COVID-19 has hastened this change in work practice and although only a small numbers of my clients use it so far, where it is used it is far more efficient. The tendency to write emails-as-treatise in academia is still quite prevalent and when I have found myself sliding into this habit (e.g. &gt;10mins composing an email), I have saved the email as a note and called the person instead. If you can do this too, your learning technologist will thank you (trust me!). Also as a dyslexic, I have often been concerned about how I perceived via the medium of email. Emails end up being more like letters, language and vocabulary can be judged. Furthermore, my tendency to forget words from sentences as my brain works faster than my personal language centres has been a perpetual source of self-critique. With chat I can write the answer with less fear and can always correct a spelling or add a word after the fact. It makes solutions faster and language less precious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Resourcefulness vs. idiosyncrasy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the downsides users sourcing of their own solutions is that the local setup does not always match the technology developer's ideal. For example, folks find exciting help guides which suggest that they can schedule MS Teams meetings via their calendar. These features are not available due to differences in the local setup and this means that some of a learning technologist's job is about tempering expectations. It does point to the end of branding and idiosyncrasy. To support more as learning technologists we potentially need to have fewer home-grown elements and this means that branding the VLE/ePortfolio/[insert eLearning tool here] is not as sustainable as it was in the past. This is also true due to the frequency of updates. Vendors are far more responsive to suggestions from users and interfaces change at a steady rate making it tricky to stay on-top of help documentation especially when in a continuous delivery, Software-as-a-Service model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the notion of home-grown, I would add 'fudger' to my definition of a learning technologist: adviser-integrator-augmenter-translator-<em>fudger</em>. A learning technologist has MacGyver abilities for sure, <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://er.educause.edu/articles/2020/3/the-difference-between-emergency-remote-teaching-and-online-learning"" target=""_blank"">Hodges <em>et al.</em> (2020)</a> also make this analogy, to transmute existing technologies to fit a need for which the technology was not originally designed. At any given time I am managing and sustaining so many of these 'solutions'. With the increased demand for my services, the 'paper clips' have started to slip and I have come to realise that this is hidden work which could and should be managed using specialist tools. All of these <em>fudges</em> might actually be more expensive in terms of time expenditure than working on a more holistic solution. Furthermore when <em>fudges</em> are applied in the learning space, rather than say an administrative space, they can lack digital authenticity as in using a tool designed for one thing as another. The experience of using such a solution may differ from students' broader experiences of technology and cause a level of dissatisfaction; a square peg. It is easier to smooth these things over when you are teaching in-person, harder when the interaction is front-and-centre and it doesn't <em>feel</em> like the right solution.</p>

<h3>Online learning?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up until recently, I quoted the excellent article in the <a href=""https://er.educause.edu/articles/2020/3/the-difference-between-emergency-remote-teaching-and-online-learning""><em>Educause Review</em> by Hodges <em>et al.</em> (2020)</a> and would say that we have been ""emergency remote teaching"" rather than producing online learning. Having said that, this is now shifting in a very exciting way, and the hybridised designs that I am starting to see for future teaching demonstrate astounding progress in a short time. Part of the challenge of redesign of teaching and delivery is that there is no longer a default. The defaults before were: just do whatever it is in-person, or print it out and give it to people. I cannot tell you how many times I advised on technology and even helped to setup a solution to hear that the person got worried and returned to the 'safe' solution of in-person oft to never revisit the technology again. This is no longer an option and it <em>is </em>scary. The closest that we have to a default is the VLE and sometimes I have to remind people that it exists amongst all the <em>new </em>and shiny; it is our dependable pal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Experience at the picnic blanket level</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly interactions and micro-interactions are gaining importance and this is a very good thing. I have been using Charles and Ray Eames <em>Powers of Ten </em>video for IBM (1977) as an analogy for this in teaching. Suddenly the focus has changed, we are at the picnic blanket level. The clicks are important, the minutes are important in the hours of a day of teaching content. This is key because although as educators we cannot compete with the attention-to-detail that UI/UX designers apply to micro-interactions in software applications, but like designers we are creating an experience and every interaction is part of that experience. </p>

<h2>The Corridor Effect™️</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Corridor Effect™️ may not be the final title of this phenomena, I am still considering it, because really it is about the lack of corridors. Think about how much information we glean from colleagues in corridors, how those encounters build social cohesion and provide other perspectives and most importantly differing interpretations of information. Right now we are all in our own bubbles and this can profoundly affect some students who find locating and prioritising information difficult. They may have relied on the organisation and perception of others to stay up-to-date before. That is no longer an option, unless we build in these opportunities. Discussion boards, encouragement of study groups, specific support groups for some students; all of these approaches and more can be used and must be used. The consequence of not doing so means that the gap between those who understand the rules of academic game and those who are still learning how to play will exponentially grow.</p>

<h3>Teaching with empathy<sup><a href=""#empathy"">2</a></sup></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that as educators, now more than ever we need to think deeply about the experience of engaging with learning as a journey. For us, we may have travelled this particular learning path many times; we may have taught the same content over successive iterations of a course/module. For the students it is most likely their first time and add to that the current personal, professional and societal challenges and undoubtedly this is a big ask. I have seen some amazing examples of empathetic, yet rigorous, teaching over the past few months and despite the challenges currently facing Higher Education internationally, this gives me hope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This post is an unabashed summary of my ideas, perhaps fledging ideas, and I do not doubt that these ideas have surfaced elsewhere in educational theory. However, I feel that sometimes writing from experience and considering how something exists and feels at a given time is a valuable endeavour and I plan to test and revisit these notions in the months-to-come. Thank you for reading.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><sup>1</sup><a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"" target=""_blank"">Agile</a> is not a panacea, it is imperfect. However, I have had a glimpse of a new world of productivity and personally believe that problems should be viewed as a dataset rather than our raison d'etre as a profession. We will not be able to respond to the ongoing demands of this crisis if we are stretched in too many different directions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><sup>2</sup>Empathy is a term that has been overused in design, but it is a term which has never been more relevant when used in its truest sense. Empty empathy when used in a purely semantic sense is worse than none. True empathy is about taking time to think deeply about the path as it is travelled by others. For more on this, I highly recommend reading the designer, <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://indiyoung.com/pubs-apps/"" target=""_blank"">Indi Young's writing</a>.</p>

Design Implications</strong></td>

<tr>
<td>Age</td>
<td>Mid 20s - 67+</td>
<td>Need to consider needs of different age groups in terms of knowledge of technology and accessibility, for aspects such as text size and interactive features.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sex</td>
<td>M/F or Non-binary</td>
<td>Language should be gender neutral to promote equality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ethnicity</td>
<td>Multiple</td>
<td>Should be inline with university-x equality and diversity guidelines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Location</td>
<td>South Coast of England, available internationally.</td>
<td>Can have a slight English and university-x flavour, but regional colloquialisms, either written or through visual reference should be avoided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Education</td>
<td>Graduate and post graduate level.</td>
<td>Pace of the learning object should have options to accommodate different learning speeds. A certain level of knowledge can be assumed for educational concepts, but not for technology concepts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Socioeconomic status</td>
<td>In 8 classes model, aimed at L2 and above. <a href=""http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html"">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html</a></td>
<td>Design needs to evoke professionalism; clear, approachable, reputable. Clearly branded as a university-x tool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ownership</td>
<td>Access to a work computer and/or home computer with an Internet connection in order to complete the LO.</td>
<td>The design is for personal computers as the LO relates to software which is primarily used on personal computers (Microsoft Word). Access to Microsoft Word for work and home computers is provided by university-x, however it is possible that it will not be installed on the computer used to complete the LO. For these situations the activity based in a Word document is optional and the activity can be completed on a different computer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mobility</td>
<td>May work across campuses, may work from home.</td>
<td>
Need to the ability to save their work and return to the LO later on possibly on a different computer. As this will not be linked to university-x authentication, an access key will need to be generated that the user can enter, in order to resume their progress.
Need to account for weak broadband as staff who live in smaller towns and villages will not have a robust broadband connection as compared to those who live in cities. Different countries also have varying connection speeds and university-x has some teaching programmes abroad, which may be affected slow connectivity.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Individual</td>
<td>All tasks are individual</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team</td>
<td>Tasks completed contribute to a school/department wide goal</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Concurrency</td>
<td>It is possible that the staff person will keep the LO while they work in Microsoft Word for certain activities. It may also be open among other browser tabs and software on their computer.</td>
<td>Make sure that the LO automatically caches in the browser, so work is not lost if LO is left open. The link is unique and can be returned to. If browser is closed without saving (and adding contact email) then work would be lost, so a warning would be needed if the user tried to close the LO window without saving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Frequency</td>
<td>Infrequently. Could be completed in one sitting, but more likely that staff will dip in and out of the LO until completed.</td>
<td>Needs to be very easy to get back into the LO and resume where left off. A display of progress for each topic would be helpful here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goals</td>
<td>To learn how to create accessible Microsoft Word documents and to improve existing documents, as well as increase personal knowledge of best practices to support disabled students.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corporate Goals</td>
<td>Increase awareness of accessibility as a consequence to changes in DSA funding.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>False Goals</td>
<td>False goal: the LO will teach the end-user to use Microsoft Word. The LO is aimed at existing Word users and not those who are new to the software.</td>
<td>This level of user experience needs to be articulated to the end-user in the introduction to the LO.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=""3""><strong>
Cognitive
</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Literacy</td>
<td>Literate: English may not be first language, but academic English fluency is expected.</td>
<td>To make using the LO pleasurable and straightforward, language should be clear and practical. Make reference to the Plain English guide: <a title=""Plain English"" href=""http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/files/howto.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/files/howto.pdf</a></td>

Affect
</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Motivation</td>
<td>Extrinsic - government/employer/student needs</td>
<td>The government's changes partially motivate the need for change. Employers have recognised the need and put the tool in place to instruct academic staff. Staff may be motivated by a wish to better support student accessibility needs.</td>

<td>In order to work with this, the LO should celebrate what the user is doing already. It would be really helpful if this could be supported by statistics in the interface, although this would take a while to build up. E.g. you already save your lecture notes to PDF - that's great 67% of the respondents on this LO reported that they already do that too. This may not be possible as it would complicate the system, but it would be helpful to encourage good practice with for example, student quotes explaining why they like getting materials in a specific format or for example, showing the accessibility options for a PDF in a short video as a side note.</td>

<td>17 years - 67+ years</td>
<td>Need to consider needs of different age groups in terms of knowledge of technology and accessibility, for aspects such as text size and interactive features.</td>

<tr>
<td>Sex</td>
<td>M/F or Non-binary</td>
<td>Language should be gender neutral to promote equality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ethnicity</td>
<td>Multiple</td>
<td>Should be inline with university equality and diversity guidelines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Location</td>
<td>South Coast of England, available internationally</td>
<td>Can have a slight English and university-x flavour, but regional colloquialisms, either written or through visual reference should be avoided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Education</td>
<td>Foundation to post-graduate level.</td>
<td>Although the LO is primarily for staff the options to accommodate differing learning speeds. This should make the tool more accessible to students and staff in other roles. It is possible that this group will struggle more with some of the educational concepts so the inclusion of glossary-type elements would be helpful.</td>

<td>Socioeconomic status</td>
<td>In 8 classes model, aimed at L2 and above. <a href=""http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html"">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html</a></td>
<td>Design needs to evoke professionalism; clear, approachable, reputable. Clearly branded as a university-x tool. Students with an interest in using the LO may be entering a teaching related field or have an interest in learning technologies. So although students may not be in the L2 bracket yet, their prospective professional employment after graduation will place them in this class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ownership</td>
<td>Access to a work computer, library computer and/or home computer with an Internet connection in order to complete the LO.</td>
<td>The design is for personal computers as the LO relates to software which is primarily used on personal computers (Microsoft Word). Access to Microsoft Word for work and home computers is provided by university-x, however it is possible that it will not be installed on the computer used to complete the LO. For these situations the activity based in a Word document is optional and the activity can be completed on a different computer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mobility</td>
<td>May work across campuses, may work from home, coffee shops etc.</td>
<td>
Need to the ability to save their work and return to the LO later on possibly on a different computer. As this will not be linked to university-x authentication, an access key will need to be generated that the user can enter, in order to resume their progress.
May be low bandwidth depending on location.</td>

<td>It is possible that the student/staff person will keep the LO while they work in Microsoft Word for certain activities. It may also be open among other browser tabs and software on their computer.</td>
<td>Make sure that the LO automatically caches in the browser, so work is not lost if LO is left open. The link is unique and can be returned to. If browser is closed without saving (and adding contact email) then work would be lost, so a warning would be needed if the user tried to close the LO window without saving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Frequency</td>
<td>Infrequently. Could be completed in one sitting, but more likely that staff will dip in and out of the LO until completed.</td>
<td>Needs to be very easy to get back into the LO and resume where left off. A display of progress for each topic would be helpful here.</td>

<td>To learn how to create accessible Microsoft Word documents and to improve existing documents, as well as increase personal knowledge of best practices to support disabled students.</td>
<td></td>

<tr>
<td>False Goals</td>
<td>False goal: the LO will teach the end-user to use Microsoft Word. The LO is aimed at existing Word users and not those who are new to the software.</td>

Recently I was asked to present at the Media-Enhanced Learning Special Interest Group (MELSIG) event hosted by the University of Sussex. MELSIG is a special interest group originally formed in 2008 (MELSIG, 2014). The group's focus has evolved, alongside contemporary developments in technology, to include investigation of a wide variety of digital media when applied to the support of learning and teaching. The theme for the University of Sussex event was <em>Digital Media Interaction and Inclusivity</em> and this was exactly the prompt I needed to engage in more thorough research of in-app adjustment functions which has been preoccupation of mine for a while.

Through my work building 'communities of practice' (Wenger, 1998) on both sides of the Atlantic, and in particular during the development of <a title=""DIY – Build Your Own App Swap Events"" href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearning/the-team/case-studies/diy-build-your-own-app-swap-breakfasts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>App Swap</em> </a>events at the University of Brighton something always bothered me about apps or mobile applications/software. Namely why, when developers have such rich <a title=""Software Development Kit"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SDKs</a> to work with, isn't there more attention to paid to inclusivity when designing apps? Both the iOS and Android operating systems have a number of built-in functions which have the potential to greatly aid accessibility in addition to the benefits afforded by the touchscreens and the form factors of the devices themselves. However, due to the unique conditions under which apps are developed a combination of factors including time/monetary constraints, corporate interests and the lack of a common accessibility guidelines seem to stifle the potential of certain apps on the accessibility front. Indeed within app development no equivalent to the <a title=""WC3 WAI"" href=""http://www.w3.org/WAI/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WC3's Web Accessibility Initiative</a> seems to have emerged and the rule systems applied to website design such as the <a title=""EU Internet Handbook"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/standards/accessibility/index_en.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">EU Internet Handbook</a> have no bearing on the design of apps. On the one hand this is quite liberating for interface designers and has led to something of a <em>Wild West</em> populated by some truly innovative interface designs.

My intention with this post, I should point out, is not to stifle innovation, but rather I would like to propose that when an app's primary purpose falls within certain categories of use, 'categories' which can be applied to the creation or consumption of educational materials or be used in support of learning, that extra attention be paid to the accessibility features of 'said' apps. Perhaps in the future this could resemble a set of agreed standards, but at this time I would like to make more of a humble request rather than a full recommendation. The core idea I put forth in relation to my 'request' is the notion of letting the user choose and customise the app through the presence of 'adjustment'; this I believe is a key facet of the path to accessibility. I shall expand on 'categories of use' later in this post.

A personal experience which prompted this line of enquiry was my use of Amazon's Kindle app for iPad. In October 2011 Apple introduced support of text-to-speech (TTS) within their iOS5 operating system (Moren, D. 2012); as a Dyslexic person I was eager to make use of this function and to this day find it immensely useful. Imagine my disappointment to find out that the 'Speak Selection' tool is actively blocked within the Kindle app. The 'VoiceOver' tool was later allowed within the Kindle for iPad app (Ingber, J. 2013) and Amazon had introduced its own text-to-speech function to the Kindle 2 device in 2009 but eBook publishers could choose to disallow the function with the viewpoint that it might damage audiobook sales (Schofield, J. 2009). There is another aspect of the Kindle app which always seems a bit of an oversight; reading background colours. Given the development resources available to Amazon, there are only three options provided for the text background colour: White, Black (X-Ray) and Sepia. Why not make the reading experience as accessible as possible by including customisable background colours as evidenced by apps like <a title=""bluefire reader developer site"" href=""http://www.bluefirereader.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bluefire Reader</a>, <a title=""Kobo Reader apps"" href=""http://www.kobo.com/apps"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kobo Reader</a> and <a title=""Goodreader developer site"" href=""http://www.goodiware.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodreader</a>? When comparing Kindle to particularly Kobo reader and Goodreader one is reminded of the oft used technological paradigm of VHS and Betamax; VHS won due to market share in combination with other factors rather than viewing quality.

On the topic of background colour more specifically, from a personal perspective this is the number one 'adjustment' which I would like to see made available in apps. Particularly those apps which are promoted as 'readers'. My own perception of black text on a white background has been a persistent barrier to my consumption and enjoyment of reading. To help elaborate on my own experience I even created <a title=""dylexic irlen sketch"" href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a javascript web application</a> (using <a title=""processing.org"" href=""http://processing.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Processing</a>) to show what this experience is like for me. This is a condition sometimes known as Irlen Syndrome, Meres-Irlen Syndrome, Visual Stress or Scoptopic Sensitivity syndrome. I am hesitant to adopt any of these definitions as an explanation of my experience, as I have never received an official diagnosis. Furthermore there are some sceptical viewpoints in the medical fields when assessing the diagnostic procedures and the original studies which led to the recognition of the symptoms (Coyle, B. 1995 and Lawrence, J. 2008). I prefer to view it as a complex part of my own dyslexic puzzle and one thing is not in doubt, the ability to adjust background colours, fonts and font-sizes makes a huge difference to my experience of reading.

So why the title of <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>? The 2011 film, <em>The Adjustment Bureau </em>based on the Phillip K. Dick's short story, <em>The Adjustment Team</em> (1954 - <a title=""full text source"" href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adjustment_Team"">full text</a>) which tells of characters whose life choices deviate from a preordained plan set-out by a mysterious organisation. Inspired by this idea I postulated that there may be a parallel between that concept and app developers whose choices are guided or pushed by a combination of external factors and client influences, ultimately I wondered whether this explains why the avenues to accessibility are so seldom followed? With all of this in mind I decided to enter into an assessment of the adjustment functionality available within some of the most prominent and popular apps I have encountered while working in Higher Education. I focused on apps available for iOS for this pursuit as that is the primary device type supported in my workplace and I had access to the devices. This also prompted me to define some basic 'categories of use' when applied to app use within academia for the support of learning and teaching.

The <strong>Categories of Use</strong> are as follows:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Category</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Browser</td>
<td>A web browser for navigating web-based information. May include other features such as reader functions and RSS curation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Composer</td>
<td>In this context for the composition of text-based materials and documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consumer</td>
<td>For curation and consumption of RSS content, blogs and online news sources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Notetaker/annotation</td>
<td>Apps with the main purpose of taking notes and/or placing notes and annotation on documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reader</td>
<td>Apps with the primary purpose of reading text, eBooks, ePubs, PDF and other text formats. May have limited annotation tools.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
When defining the categories I tried to resist the use of pre-existing desktop software definitions such as for example '<em>word processing'. </em>These definitions have established associations and many apps reach beyond the format-based outputs which are expected from these former software definitions.

The <strong>Adjustment </strong><strong>Criteria</strong> upon which each app was judged are listed below. If an app includes a feature it is awarded a point for that criterion, it may partially allow a feature which would result in a 0.5 of a point. The total score is a point value out of a total of 8, for the 8 criteria and is shown as a final percentage. Apps which achieve &gt;=60% are highlighted in purple.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Criterion</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Font Size</td>
<td>Font size can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Line Height</td>
<td>Line height can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Font Style</td>
<td>Font style can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Invert/Brightness</td>
<td>Brightness of the display or invert (white text on black background) is a specific option within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sepia</td>
<td>A sepia background (beige/mild yellow) is a specific option within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sliders/Colour</td>
<td>A selection of colours or Red/Green/Blue sliders allow the user to adjust and specify the background colour within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pinch zoom</td>
<td>The pinch zoom is a built-in function of the iOS. Some apps do not make/allow full use of this touch-based function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS Speak Selection</td>
<td>A function which can be enabled in the General &gt; Accessibility functions in the iOS this can be used by selecting text in certain apps and pressing the 'speak' option which comes up. This is distinct from the 'Voiceover' option which is a complete audio interface and harder use for quick impromptu needs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The scores as an embedded Google Spreadsheet - a work in progress. NB: this list is not designed to be exhaustive and if you have other apps which you would like me to assess using these criteria, please add them to the comments area below. The ""+"" next to the app title identifies that the app is available for both iPhone and iPad.

<strong>Conclusion
</strong>Through this process of investigation and app functionality testing I feel that I have only begun to scrape the surface of how accessibility functions are implemented and the possible avenues for improvement. I think that there is certainly scope to devise a more concrete scoring and testing system with the view to helping teachers and learners make informed decisions about the accessibility functions of certain apps. Such a system would also have the potential to help inform developers about the needs of specific user groups. However the responsibility cannot be squarely that of the developers, as users we also have a responsibility to let developers know what we want and need. One of the benefits of working with apps is that developers are often small to medium sized companies and really benefit from the suggestions from their user-base, this may extend to use testing. In the <em>Wild West</em> of apps we as the user have an opportunity to make a difference and we shouldn't miss out by sticking to the easy path.

As part of this process I have been considering my arsenal of apps. I'll likely talk about the full extent of my app choice plotting in future posts. In this post I shall provide my reflections on notetaking apps in-particular. In my experience early preparation has always been the best strategy when considering any new academic venture, so I look forward to sharing some of my findings on this blog in the lead up to and during my forthcoming period of study.
In my professional life I have become a devotee of <a title=""Evernote website"" href=""https://evernote.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Evernote</a>. I was not by any means an early adopter or rather I was but I got burned by a glitch circa 2009 which resulted in the loss on my web-based notes (at that time using it in-browser). I must stress that such a loss is not likely to happen with Evernote now but back then it was a relatively new thing and when on the cutting edge you may occasionally experience virtual paper cuts (thankfully I only lost a few notes)! However last year Evernote won my heart again when I decided that I wanted a solution with note tagging (keywords), multi-platform compatibility (in my case, Mac, PC, iOS, Android) and OCR capabilities (text recognition). After looking at a few app-based solutions it was the only option which gave me the flexibility I was craving.
In my work I have come to rely on Evernote as an excellent option for recording meetings and consultations, being able to send a record of what was discussed and any actions to a staff person immediately after the meeting. I then link this information to my to-dos in <a title=""Trello website"" href=""https://trello.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Trello</a> (I'll write about the wonders of Trello some other time). Sometimes when I'm particularly busy I quickly jot ideas or tasks down on paper and then use Evernote's document capture function to take a photo. I am always impressed by the OCR capabilities of Evernote when it comes to recognising my squiggly handwriting and making it searchable (the detects words in handwriting rather than converting handwriting to type). Also when you add in the photo annotation tools made possible through Evenote's partner app <a title=""Skitch App"" href=""https://evernote.com/skitch/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Skitch</a> I am one happy customer.
But...and you knew that this was coming, there is something to be said for handwriting and when it comes to deeper notetaking and truly learning concepts; I personally need to write concepts down to retain and understand them. When the iPad first came out in 2010 (Apple, 2010) I was an early adopter and one of the first apps I fell in love with was <a title=""Penultimate app site"" href=""https://evernote.com/penultimate/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Penultimate</a>. This app lets you draw or write with a stylus or your finger in virtual notebooks, later they added being able to add photos and voila it became a virtual sketchbook! I no longer wanted to carry a moleskin and an iPad and for a while Penultimate served me well for quick notetaking. Penultimate was acquired by Evernote in 2012 (Libin, 2012) and with that came the OCR capability of being able to 'search' your handwritten notes. However there were three functions which I have always felt are missing from Penultimate app which eventually caused me to abandon it. The first is the absence of a adequate notebook file management system, in apps like <a title=""Goodreader site"" href=""http://www.goodiware.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodreader</a>, <a title=""iAnnotatePDF site"" href=""http://www.branchfire.com/iannotate/#makepaperjealous"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">iAnnotatePDF</a> and <a title=""Notability site - Gingerlabs"" href=""http://www.gingerlabs.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Notability</a>, although more strictly for annotation of imported files, these apps allowed a far superior filing system. For example in iAnnotatePDF you can tag files with keywords, create folders and connect to Sharepoint (MyFiles) via WebDAV for backup purposes. In Penultimate, you just have an ever growing pile of notebooks.

The second issue is the background colour, from my <a title=""The Adjustment Bureau: The Case for Adjustment in Mobile Apps"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2014/09/07/the-adjustment-bureau/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">previous post</a> you'll know that background colour is very important to my efficiency when reading and writing. You do have the option of importing a photo to use as a background, so in theory that is a workaround and you can purchase notepaper types from Evernote Market, there are some good ones but these are more to do with line based layouts than page background colour. I have also found this <a title=""iPadPapers site"" href=""http://ipadpapers.com/tag.asp?tag=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">enterprising site</a> which allows you to create your own templates for Penultimate as well as use templates which other's have created, in particular I was happy to find a <a title=""Cornell PDF tutorial"" href=""http://lsc.cornell.edu/LSC_Resources/cornellsystem.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Cornell Notes format</a> template after the recent <a title=""MELSIG event page"" href=""http://melsig.shu.ac.uk/?page_id=645"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MELSIG</a> presentation about it. With any drawing/handwriting app, as a workaround, you could draw a template on the page, but then it becomes tricky when you need to cut and paste your written sections as the background gets confused with your written content.

[caption id=""attachment_77"" align=""alignnone"" width=""550""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NotesPlus_Backgroundcolours-2k8wz3p.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""size-large wp-image-77"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NotesPlus_Backgroundcolours-2k8wz3p-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""Notes Plus"" width=""550"" height=""412""></a> Notes Plus - the myriad of background colour and template options available in Notes Plus.[/caption]

The third issue is the lack of an adjustable on-screen wrist protector. Penultimate allows you to define your wrist position but as you will see from the image below, it has trouble deciding which marks my stylus is making and which marks my wrist is making. This was the deal-breaker, I'd be mid-flow in writing and half of what I'd written would fail to show up as in Penultimate's view my wrist had been doing the writing!

[caption id=""attachment_76"" align=""alignnone"" width=""385""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/penultimate_wrist-183un00.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class="" wp-image-76 "" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/penultimate_wrist-183un00-768x1024.jpg"" alt=""penultimate"" width=""385"" height=""513""></a> Penultimate - the effect of wrist shown.

So after four years of on and off trial and error, with periodic abandonment of the idea of handwriting on my iPad other than using very helpful PDF annotation apps for small comments (another post about these apps specifically in the future), I think that I have finally come up with my ideal list of functions which a handwriting app needs - and one app fits almost all of them - Notes Plus with Notability taking a close second place.
<strong>My ideal list of functions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>File management</strong> and ideally creation of folders or notebooks for storage of different note types</li>
 	<li><strong>Background page colour</strong> and template adjustment</li>
 	<li>Adjustable <strong><strong>on-screen wristguard
</strong></strong>

<strong>Conclusions:</strong>
For written notes Notes Plus wins hands-down and it is also superb for combining PDFs, Word documents and written notes into self-contained notebooks or virtual binders. I have resolved to use it for the purpose of textbook related notes over the next few months. I'll report back on how it goes.
For decent notetaking and excellent PDF annotation Notability has clear benefits.
iAnnotatePDF's clear advantage over the other apps is its excellent file management &nbsp;system and also the ability to place audio comments in context within a document.

So here are my initial thoughts on the app with a few caveats:
<ul>
	<li>It is early days for this app and I believe that it is a Beta, see the Blackboard labs site for more details: <a title=""Blackboard Labs"" href=""http://www.blackboard.com/sites/labs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.blackboard.com/sites/labs/</a></li>
	<li>This app bears a strong relationship to the User Interface (UI) and structural changes which are to come as part of the Ultra release. This release will not be available for a while (estimated 2016) and even when it is, it may take a while for institutions to move to that version due to the complete re-design planned for the UI.
<ul>
	<li>Here is a nice visual preview of Ultra in case you are interested: <a title=""EdTech Connection Blog - Ultra"" href=""http://blog.ericsilva.me/blackboard/learn/blackboard-learn-screenshots/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://blog.ericsilva.me/blackboard/learn/blackboard-learn-screenshots/</a></li>
	<li>Here are the webinar recordings from Blackboard showcasing Ultra: <a title=""Blackboard Sneak Peak Webinars"" href=""http://webinars.blackboard.com/UXSneakPeekRecording"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://webinars.blackboard.com/UXSneakPeekRecording</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Finally these are just my initial observations and I fully acknowledge that there may be structural and terminology changes prior to a release of the app in the UK. Also as the app is a Beta, I accept that changes and updates may currently be in the works to improve functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Information Design and Structure</strong></h2>
This app is designed for a smartphone screen size and has an immediacy to the presentation of information which I like. Upon opening the app you would* be confronted by the useful, just-in-time information in your <em>Stream. </em>Your <em>Stream </em>would aggregate course and module activity and replies to your blog/wiki/discussion board posts. This is somewhat similar to the updates aggregated within the <a title=""Global Navigation and other updates in April 2014"" href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearning/2014/06/09/whats-new-in-studentcentral/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Global Navigation</a> (April 2014 version of Blackboard). A downwards sweep with a finger reveals that the structure of this app is very simple; you can access your <em>Stream</em> or your <em>Courses</em> and there are no other complications. Well almost...there is a cog icon to indicate settings options, but at this point there is nothing to access in that area and a feedback area for entry of a contact email address.
*Would = the stream is not loading on my version of the app. I am able to access my institutional materials in the Courses area, but our implementation of Blackboard is not configured for the stream at this time.
<h4><strong>Courses</strong></h4>
At the top of the Courses area there is a large header stating the word ""Current"", this suggests that at some point the app will distinguish between the current term, or current modules/courses being studied and past modules/courses. We cannot see that distinction within the app yet, but this is a promising development as a means to help signpost students to the correct information.
Each course is shown as a rectangular block, featuring a coloured strip, a title, the name of the <em>Professor* </em>(academic staff person) and a spot for their avatar (<a title=""avatar definition"" href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/avatar"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">avatar definition, see ""4""</a>). There are a couple of potential issues with this, if you have more than one instructor assigned to an area then the area is listed as ""Professor not yet assigned"". Furthermore even in a module area when only one instructor was assigned and 'said' instructor had an avatar loaded within Blackboard, ""Professor not yet assigned"" is still shown on the Course block and the avatar is not picked up; only a black circle with a question mark on it is displayed. This speaks to two points, where is app looking to find avatars and does it have very specific requirements for compatible images? Also the use of roles within Blackboard may become more pertinent in future, this aligns with my experience of working with moodle in the US due to the <a title=""FERPA information"" href=""http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">FERPA</a> legislation which is akin to data protection and mandates whom can access coursework and grades etc. Use of access-based roles is important in order to comply with the rules outlined in FERPA.
Pressing on a Course block takes you into that specific course/module area. Within the course area, the instructor name and image is shown at the top with resources immediately below, and this is where it gets interesting, most of your content areas will be ignored and in our case the app is only picking a content area which we label as ""Study Materials"" by default within all out modules. Furthermore if I look at a specific module within ""Study Materials"" I have the following content types: <em>items,</em> these are not shown in the app; a <em>wiki,</em> this is not shown within the app; and a <em>journal</em>, which is also not shown within the app. What is shown, are <em>folders, weblinks</em>, you can see a <em>test </em>activity exists, but you cannot yet take it. I do think that the windowed in-app browser for viewing web pages is a step in the right direction, it includes back (&lt;) and forward (&gt;) arrows, a refresh and an option to copy the link or open it in the native OS web browser (iOS Safari). This is a marked improvement on how web pages display in the Blackboard Mobile Learn app in my opinion. Without more development related to the display of content items, I cannot comment further on those aspects of the app at this time.
*As shown in the screen shot below it looks like there would be a time and location in the course/module area as well. This briefly flickers up when loading but then disappears as that kind of data is not available in our instance of Blackboard.

<h2>User Interface Design and User Experience</h2>
First of all, a few points about the UI. I think that it is pretty good although it does suffer from the same issue as the Blackboard Mobile Learn app, a bleach-white backdrop. However unlike the Blackboard Mobile Learn app you do not end up with a matryoshka doll effect, where the nesting levels can become very confusing. What I like about it is that when you are in a folder in this app, you are actually <strong>in</strong> that folder and you press an X to get out of it, and back up to the next level. This flattened structure where we essentially end up with one content area seems to correlate with what I have seen of Ultra.
The new <em>folder</em>, <em>link</em> and <em>course</em> icon design is strong and easy to understand. The removal of the shadowing effects seen in the desktop version of Blackboard, in favour of simple vector graphics in the app is a good decision. The icons are even further simplified than the versions that we see in Blackboard Mobile Learn app, yet similar enough to give existing users a frame of reference. I do think that the choice of a stock-icon wireframe globe icon to represent the stream is a weak point. The <em>posts </em>icon currently used in the Global Navigation would seem more evocative of a stream if we're talking icons (quite like an Aquarius star sign symbol, so that association makes sense).
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""63""]<img class="""" src=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearning/files/2014/06/gn_activity_stream-2ebbhqg.png"" alt=""posts icon - from Blackboard Global Navigation"" width=""63"" height=""67"" /> posts icon - from Global Navigation[/caption]
&nbsp;
The navigation is probably my favourite aspect of the app. From the two options at the outset in the app home area, <em>Stream</em> or <em>Courses, </em>to the pile of your recently visited courses/modules gathered at the bottom of 'said' home area, there is a welcome level of simplicity. I also like the forethought put into multiple navigation paths, especially in terms of returning to the previous level of the app. So if you are in a course/module, you can sweep a finger down from the top and return to the course/module listings, another sweep down will take you to the home area. If that isn't intuitive, and for some it won't be, there is a ""burger-style"" menu (design~ ""<a title=""Burger icon - Johan Van Dem Rym's Site"" href=""http://jvandenrym.me/2014/10/10/the-beefy-icon/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">burger</a>"" or ""club sandwich"") on the top-left of every view that will take you back to the home area. What is particularly unique about the interface, is that in order to provide the user with confirmation of shifting levels, the bars which identify which level you are on give a satisfying jelly-like bounce when you use a finger to sweep upwards or downloads. The ""burger"" menu also has a bounce to it, a bit like your finger's pressure left an indent in it. Nice little design touches which add a bit of character to the app. Another good feature is the use of vibrant colour as an affirmation of touch selections in the grey/black home area.
<strong>Suggestions for Improvement</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Allow users to change the background colour. Yes, white says clean and simple, but it presents accessibility issues for Dyslexic users. A plus on accessibility for font choice and sizing though!</li>
	<li>Bring in more content types soon please! I would love to see how a blog or discussion board will be shown in this app.</li>
	<li>Bring in some simple sorting to the course area. I see where we are going with the Ultra structure (only the current courses being shown) but the arbitrary colour stripes for each course seem like a step backwards. I think that users might expect the sorting and colour labelling available in Blackboard Mobile Learn app.</li>
</ul>
Overall I think that this app has a lot of potential, although it has quite a long way to go. I look forward to seeing how the functionality develops over the coming months.

Last week, I received an email featuring questions about how to use an iPad to support qualitative research fieldwork. I have explored many facets of using an iPad, but thinking about the device in relation to research pulls together some of the most useful functions into a neat contextual package which you can tap-into (pun intended!). Essentially for new users, research can be a gateway to get more out of your device and for established users...research can also be a gateway to get more out of your device! I owe a debt of gratitude to the person who sent me such good questions; as not only have they inspired this blog post, but they have also laid the trail for today's #appswap.

Live blogging from the conference, which took place on the 29th of April, 2015 at University of Salford, Manchester.
Introductory statement - Martin Cope points to factors which have stood in the way of widespread adoption of mobile technologies in further and higher education. We have reached beyond the tipping point, folks in attendance have an array of titles related to eLearning, but there is still much networking and collaboration to be done.
First speaker: Jon Fowler
Introducing the technology for use during the conference. We are using an app called meetoo.
Meetoo is a real-time messaging and poling app
Can access from Apple, Android and HTML
Web-based
Like many applications of this flavour it requires a pin to join up to the session.
He is running the ""instructor/meeting lead"" from his device. Real-time results much like poll everywhere.
Has a nice free text function, which has the option to be moderated as well.

Jonny Driscoll
Founder and CEO, Unipin
Driscoll came up with the concept of Unipin while he was at University. Noticed that there were lots of events at the university, but hardly anyone was in attendance.
Refers in Simin Sinec talk on tech, talks about innovative tech.
Mentions the Social Learning Model
Unipin is a social learning environment - engage students
Personalised activities lists, modelled on Pinterest-like wireframing.
Student and staff focus
Talking about the balance of academic and social experiences as being important to university life and experience.
Group chat based around module structure.
Can upload videos from mobile
Has calendar and notification system and suggested events based upon the student's profiles.
Mention that they record their achievements in the system - a kind of portfolio at the end of their time at the university.
The tool is aimed at student retention and getting students to attend events and taking part in uni-life and extracurricular clubs and societies.
Also in-lecture reminders and note taking functionality.
Less than 10% of students respond to their emails - not an efficient way to communicate with students.
""The fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with people who are already the way you want to be"" - Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn
Taskbar - university tab. Trying to make a seamless journey between social and learning aspects.
Social data analysis is mentioned as well - learner journey - as a record of what you have worked on.
Employers perspectives - Unipin has a record of what students have worked on.
Works across devices, tries to minimise distractions - logging into Moodle versus Unipin
Challenge was, find yesterday's lecture notes: Moodle = 55s vs. Unipin = 15s
Returning to the idea of flow and chronology for presentation - SEE earlier post about Bb Student app.
At University of Birmingham - 100,000 Facebook posts per day
Has some dashboard functionality in terms of flagging ""at risk"" students to the instructor.
They use Trello to gain insight and ideas from students.
They are using student's devices to automate students' lecture attendance.

Talking about Leeds' involvement in FutureLearn
Interesting post about a course in acting, namely biomechanics, a very physical method and how that could be successfully taught online.
Every lecture is 5mins long, scripted and highly produced - all produced as OERs
Recommend the use of animations to aid conceptual understanding.
Essentially pointing towards to the importance of visualisation (unsurprisingly I am a big fan of that!)
MOOC are nice but are not a strong recruitment tool - consideration of the profile of completers
Towards a Flipped Learning vision - mentions that lecture attendance has not been negatively impacted by flipped. Findings will be published in a paper.

Dave Harrison
Director and Co-Founder 10Eighty
Makes point about retention of material from lecture delivery.
His point is classroom training doesn't embed learning
Tying in points around social learning and employability.
How can we use technology to engage with students on an ongoing basis?
Students are your brand ambassadors
The future of work:
- mobile device is your office
- learning in the workplace will be via video, games and simulations
- networking is key
- knowledge workers
- corporate social networks
- social media literate
<strong>But what is it?</strong>
A leadership cloud - discussions, shared documents - part social media platform, part repository by the looks of things
Crowd sourcing for project work as an exemplar use.
Talk of reverse mentoring in organisations and using the tool to support that.

Talk of Google Analytics
Why a MOOC?
Search and Social Media Marketing for International business - MOOC
Resources to help students engage with different online technologies.
They monitored which videos were most popular.
Used Twitter, Dokeos, Slideshare and YouTube for delivery of their materials
Iversity is the new MOOC kid-on-the-block and Salford are working with them in future.
Businessculture.org site analytics were encouraging showing access of the new resource.

<td>Any, although in practicality,
17 years - 67+ years</td>
<td>Need to consider needs of different age groups in terms of knowledge of technology and accessibility, for aspects such as text size and interactive features.</td>

<td>Sex</td>
<td>M/F or Non-binary</td>
<td>Language should be gender neutral to promote equality.</td>

<td>Ethnicity</td>
<td>Many</td>

<tr>
<td>Location</td>
<td>South Coast of England, available internationally</td>
<td>Can have a slight English and university-x flavour, but regional colloquialisms, either written or through visual reference should be avoided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Education</td>
<td>Foundation to post-graduate level.</td>
<td>Although the LO is primarily for academic staff, there needs to be options to accommodate differing learning speeds. This should make the tool more accessible to external and possibly international audience. It is possible that educational concepts may be UK-specific so the inclusion of glossary-type element would help to support international users as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Socioeconomic status</td>
<td>In 8 classes model, aimed at L2 and above. <a href=""http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html"">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html</a></td>
<td>Design needs to evoke professionalism; clear, approachable, reputable. Clearly branded as a university-x tool. Hard to categorise an external/international audience in such linear terms. However those with an interest in the LO are most likely to be academic staff across the UK as opposed to an international audience as the information is related to UK legislation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ownership</td>
<td>Access to a work computer, library computer and/or home computer with an Internet connection in order to complete the LO.</td>
<td>The design is for personal computers as the LO relates to software which is primarily used on personal computers (Microsoft Word). It is possible that external users will not be able to complete some of the activities if they do not have access to Microsoft Word. For these situations the activity based in a Word document is optional and the activity can be completed on a different computer. This solution will already be in place for university student and other staff users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mobility</td>
<td>May work across campuses, may work from home, coffee shops etc.</td>
<td>
Need to the ability to save their work and return to the LO later on possibly on a different computer. As this will not be linked to university-x authentication, an access key will need to be generated that the user can enter, in order to resume their progress.
Need to account for weak broadband as staff who live in smaller towns and villages will not have a robust broadband connection as compared to those who live in cities. Different countries also have varying connection speeds and university-x has some teaching programmes abroad, which may be affected slow connectivity.</td>

<td>All tasks are individual.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Concurrency</td>
<td>It is possible that the external user will keep the LO while they work in Microsoft Word for certain activities. It may also be open among other browser tabs and software on their computer.</td>
<td>Make sure that the LO automatically caches in the browser, so work is not lost if LO is left open. The link is unique and can be returned to. If browser is closed without saving (and adding contact email) then work would be lost, so a warning would be needed if the user tried to close the LO window without saving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Frequency</td>
<td>Infrequently. Could be completed in one sitting, but more likely that user will dip in and out of the LO until completed.</td>
<td>Needs to be very easy to get back into the LO and resume where left off. A display of progress for each topic would be helpful here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goals</td>
<td>To learn how to create accessible Microsoft Word documents and to improve existing documents, as well as increase personal knowledge of best practices to support disabled students.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corporate Goals</td>
<td>If being asked to complete the LO by an employer: increase awareness of accessibility as a consequence to changes in DSA funding.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>False Goals</td>
<td>False goal: the LO will teach the end-user to use Microsoft Word. The LO is aimed at existing Word users and not those who are new to the software.</td>
<td>This level of user experience needs to be articulated to the end-user in the introduction to the LO.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=""3""><strong>
Cognitive
</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Literacy</td>
<td>Literate: English may not be a first language. A minimum of intermediate written English comprehension is expected.</td>
<td>To make using the LO pleasurable and straightforward, language should be clear and practical. Make reference to the Plain English guide: <a title=""Plain English"" href=""http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/files/howto.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/files/howto.pdf</a>
This will also make it more straightforward for external users to use a translation engine in their web browser (e.g. google translate, if needed). It is out of scope for the LO to be translated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=""3""><strong>
Affect
</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Motivation</td>
<td>Extrinsic - government
Intrinsic - interest in accessibility</td>
<td>The government's changes partially motivate the need for change within the UK context. Other external users might seek out the LO is they have a professional interest in accessibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interests</td>
<td>Pedagogy
Accessibility</td>
<td>Good accessibility can actively support good pedagogy. Academic staff and some students might be interested to know how accessible materials can help to support their teaching. If external users are actively seeking out the LO then it stands to reason that the accessibility emphasis is of interest to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Attitudes towards Technology</td>
<td>Varies</td>
<td>This will vary and will depend on the route to the LO. If external users actively seek out the LO then they may be more technically inclined. If the LO is shared via social media, they be inquisitive, but it will take more to keep them engaged. The interface and interaction design needs to try and introduce some unexpected fun/interest so that the LO is seen as a valuable exercise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Self-esteem</td>
<td>Self-esteem will vary.</td>
<td>Not really a factor in the same way for external users, especially as they will use the LO completely anonymously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Locus of Control</td>
<td>The user is in control of the pace, but there are set avenues of exploration.</td>
<td>This LO is a training application, so although the user can choose what they would like to learn first there are only a set number of topics. Boolean logic may be employed to determine the types of information made available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personality</td>
<td>Varies, although more introverted users could benefit from a self-paced individual learning experience</td>
<td>The design must be non-judgmental and offer optional help at each stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Visual literacy</td>
<td>Basic web-based publishing (hypertext) and document formats.</td>
<td>The LO will feature some screenshots of Microsoft Word as well as short videos or GIFs of workflows. Some base knowledge of VLEs will be beneficial.</td>

- Users who know how to create Word document files but are looking for best practice tips and an overview of what the governmental changes will entail.
- Those who have know how to handle some file types and to structure information, but may have incomplete knowledge or require a refresher.
- Beginners who are new to lecturing and may have come from a professional field where different technologies were used.
These users are based on the internal university audience, but it would help external users as well.</td>

<td>Design needs to evoke professionalism; clear, approachable, reputable. Clearly branded as a university-x tool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ownership</td>
<td>Access to a work computer, library computer and/or home computer with an Internet connection in order to complete the LO.</td>
<td>The design is for personal computers as the LO relates to software which is primarily used on personal computers (Microsoft Word). Access to Microsoft Word for work and home computers is provided by university-x, however it is possible that it will not be installed on the computer used to complete the LO. For these situations the activity based in a Word document is optional and the activity can be completed on a different computer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mobility</td>
<td>May work across campuses, may work from home, coffee shops etc.</td>
<td>
Need to the ability to save their work and return to the LO later on possibly on a different computer. As this will not be linked to university-x authentication, an access key will need to be generated that the user can enter, in order to resume their progress.
Need to account for weak broadband as staff who live in smaller towns and villages will not have a robust broadband connection as compared to those who live in cities. Different countries also have varying connection speeds and university-x has some teaching programmes abroad, which may be affected slow connectivity.</td>

<tr>
<td>Literacy</td>
<td>Literate: English may not be first language, but academic English fluency is expected. High levels of digital literacy.</td>

<td>Pedagogy and
Accessibility</td>
<td>Good accessibility can actively support good pedagogy students/staff might be interested to know how accessible materials can help to support their teaching. The technologists may be actively involved in promoting accessibility.</td>

<td>Positive</td>
<td>These users are generally positive about technology and tend to champion new technologies, as long as the technology delivers on it's promises!</td>

<tr>
<td>Self-esteem</td>
<td>High self-esteem in terms of technology use</td>
<td>May be less confident on the pedagogical side, but very self-assured when it comes to the use of the technology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Locus of Control</td>
<td>The user is in control of the pace, but there are set avenues of exploration.</td>
<td>This LO is a training application, so although the user can choose what they would like to learn first there are only a set number of topics. Boolean logic may be employed to determine the types of information made available. These support users will be well positioned to help test the aspects outlined above as they articulate potential issues more effectively then most users and will also know about potential gaps in collective knowledge.</td>
</tr>

<td>Personality</td>
<td>Varies.</td>
<td>Not such a factor as for other user groups. Although these users need to feel confident that they have a technical grasp of the system so that they can go in and troubleshoot issues, should they arise.</td>

<tr>
<td>Visual literacy</td>
<td>High level understanding of graphical communication.</td>

A key update from our conversation was that the portfolio site should have a different name in order to be more appropriate the specific medical situation that it describes. The new title is:

</ul>

</ul>
In order for me to create a characteristics list, Theo put in a request for some basic demographic information from the AFPP. Also I can base some of the characteristics for academic staff on information available at the university. I will not present these artefacts via this blog but will provide some generalised information based on what I can deduce. The purpose of this venture is for me to complete basic UX research to help make sure that I am considering the needs of my target audiences. Completing a complete characteristics list and personae is outside of scope.
<h3>The Journey</h3>
My discussion with Theo really helped me to pin down aspects of the patient journey and how that could be presented within the site. He liked the presentation format of the DuckDuckGo timeline, so I definitely need to spend more time investigating how that was made, coding-wise (AND it works in IE).
<strong>Who is our patient?</strong> We discussed potential operations for the patient and decided that a hip replacement would be a good scenario. Making use of some demographic data for this type of procedure could help to ensure that our patient seems realistic. Our scenario is placed sometime in the near future, where prescribing a wearable device as part of treatment plan is perfectly normal.
<ol>
 	<li>GP referral to a consultant and the wearable device is prescribed.</li>
 	<li>Consultation with a specialist.</li>
 	<li>Outpatient pre-operative assessment clinic.</li>
 	<li>Letter for date of operation
<ol>
 	<li>Conditional circumstance: the operation needs to be rescheduled and the new date clashes with the patient's overseas trip and causes their anxiety levels</li>
 	<li>The operation ends up being two months after the original date</li>
 	<li>In the days leading up to the operation the patient experiences high levels of anxiety and as a result the operation is rescheduled to occur first in the day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Day of operation and recovery.</li>
 	<li>Recovery and return of the device.</li>
</ol>
I have revised the Task Scenarios to reflect the changes above: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQNj8SiUKWqBOTRTo5rnLcG8NxToeAJ7B9Q1eWWRDdl-_Z-dCbCG-E8xzjOhSWc86TWtNntOcL7K84F/pub"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQNj8SiUKWqBOTRTo5rnLcG8NxToeAJ7B9Q1eWWRDdl-_Z-dCbCG-E8xzjOhSWc86TWtNntOcL7K84F/pub</a>
<h4>Additional ideas and resources to investigate</h4>
I wondered about looking at data displays of blood pressure, heart rate and visualisations of anxiety levels to inform the design. Richard Griffiths mentioned some work in the school on the design of healthcare-specific interfaces, so I will ask him if he has any further information on that.
Theo also suggested that I check out the Medopad Chemotherapy app (<a href=""http://www.medopad.com/medopad_Ltd/Chemotherapy_app.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.medopad.com/medopad_Ltd/Chemotherapy_app.html</a>) - I have taken a look and it is impressive. I especially like the Apple Watch interface.
<h4>Supporting information for Characteristics lists</h4>
Theo was also to answer some questions for me aspects of the typical work environment of a nurse in terms of access to technology. This will also help to info the design.
My original text questions along with his answers are below.
<blockquote>Q: So would a theatre nurse have access to a computer at work? A: Yes
Q: Would our expectation be that they access our website on their work computer or a personal mobile device at work?
A: Both but rather at home due to limited available time at work.
Q: What web browsers do they typically have access to at work? Internet Explorer, what version have you seen in practice?
A: most common used are IE, Firefox and Chrome
Q: If the nurses were looking at the website at work, how much time could their realistically spend looking at it (e.g. is it something that they might look at during a coffee break – suggested 12mins maximum – 5mins to understand the goals of the site).
A: Following the above comment, in the case where they look at it at work, 12 mins maximum.</blockquote>",Meeting with stakeholder,,draft,closed,open,,meeting-with-stakeholder,,,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,,0,http://itsuite.it.brighton.ac.uk/fjm19/idm18journal/?p=161,0,post,,0
825,1,12/01/2017 18:00,12/01/2017 18:00,"Dr. Theo Fotis and I met on the 11th of January to take a last look at the site prior to my assessment. This meeting was mainly for fact-checking the information that I had written, but Theo also had some thoughts on ways to add clarity to the different sections. I have outlined areas in bold below, where discussions during our meeting became actions related to the site.
<!--more-->
In the Flickity carousel/timeline for the patient timeline Theo suggested that I have a two-part scenario as the assumption that the operation would be cancelled was slightly too harsh. However, it was still collectively deemed important to include the cancellation aspect as it would have an impact on patient stress (Ebirim &amp; Tobin, 2011). This means that <strong>I will need more space in the carousel/timeline</strong> cells to accommodate this change.
The ""Why Perioperative Care?"" section was also flagged as there wasn't enough about why perioperative anxiety is imporant and how a device would make an impact. Theo suggested that <strong>I add some data to support this section</strong> and sent along some reading suggestions.
Also in certain areas I was a little bit too anxiety-specific. Theo recommended that I somehow include that there is an interest in knowing more about a patients's overall health, from a nursing perspective as well.

Although I have web development experience I am largely self-trained. Like many, I have learned as I have gone along and to be able to take this time to create something, in a methodical way from the ground-up is an opportunity that I relish! Thinking back to my most recent ventures into creating code and applications from scratch, the creative coding that I did in Processing (Fry &amp; Reas, 2016)&lt;fn&gt;
Here are some Processing sketch examples of mine in case you are interested, they are bit dated now being from 2013/14 time.

</ul>
&lt;/fn&gt; has been the closest I've come. It is time to up-the-ante and I want to create something that truly showcases my skills but also some of my current research interests. Ultimately this will manifest as a series of web pages, but I would like to push myself outside of my comfort zone. I will write more about my project idea here, once I have mapped it out a bit more.
<h3>How this journal will work</h3>
The posts in this journal will follow two reflective threads as I work through the module. The first thread is the development of this journal site, based on an independent install of the WordPress Content Management System or CMS (2016). I will outline my thinking behind decisions that I have take related to customisation and in particular accessibility and mobile responsiveness. These are the two key areas that I would like to learn more about during the module.
The second thread is related to the creation of my portfolio website. This part of the coursework will be coded from scratch and needs to rich in features, structurally sound and accessible. More on this in a future post.
<h3 id=""first"">First thoughts related to this journal site</h3>
It is important to me that this journal's theme is as accessible as possible, based on the WordPress theme templates available. At some point down the line I may even create a child-theme in order to customise it to the necessary level. For this reason I need to spend a bit of time checking the coding integrity of some of the themes that I have installed to ensure that they are suitable for customisation.
I have installed a list of themes filtered for accessibility features. Please bear with me, as in these early days, it is likely that this site might change it's skin a couple of times while I decide on a suitable theme. I will also conduct some more thorough investigations using a local copy of Wordpress and themes in MAMP (appsolute GmbH, 2016).
<h3>Provisional List of Themes for Testing:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/afterlight/"">afterlight (Automattic, 2015)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/search/chuchadon/"">chuchadon (Keijonen, 2016a)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/e-nigma-2015/"">e-nigma (Lüken, 2015)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/kuorinka/"">kuorinka (Keijonen, 2016b)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/"">twentyfifteen (WordPress.org, 2016b)</a>, <a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/"">twentysixteen (WordPress.org, 2016b)</a> (these are default bundled themes, but I have found them to be very robust as the basis for child themes in the past and also as of March (Rietveld, 2016) they must be WCAG 2 AA compliant).</li>
</ul>
In addition, I shall run some accessibility tests on the best candidate themes using the IDI Web Accessibility checker (AChecker, 2011). As well as referring to one of my favourite sources, the BBC's Future Media Standards and Guidelines to inform design decisions (BBC, 2008). The WordPress accessibility handbook is also an excellent resource (WordPress.org, 2014).
<h3>And finally...</h3>
I have chosen to install one plugin thus far. After drafting this post and realising that I have a persistent need to include asides in my reflections, I felt that having a footnote tool was essential. Yes, it is isn't strictly allowed in APA 6th Edition (Hume-Pratuch, 2014) but, this IS a journal rather than an essay so I think it is okay. I looked through the options and naturally chose the most frequently updated plugin with the most positive reviews. I was also looking at the plugin developers (Herndler &amp; Cheret, 2016a) to make sure that they had a good track record and a well maintained changelog. The developers are also using a Subversion Repository for version control (Herndler &amp; Cheret, 2016b). Based on experience I know that none of these things mean that a plugin will stand the test of time, with frequent and necessary WordPress security updates and such, however based on my assessment is seems like a robust option for the time-being.

Thus far our leaderboard (courtesy of Rise) is looking healthy, having cleared out the scores from the pre-conference tweets (pre 4:00am today that is) and re-started our polls. All of our photo scores are retained, but that still gives folks a time to catchup.
We have been tweaking our scoring strategies this morning and then I look forward to attending the sessions this afternoon. A few things that I have learned about using a Leaderboard so far...
<ol>
	<li>Adding players via the Twitter tag poll is not the most efficient practice. So I have added people manually and we encouraged players to add themselves.</li>
	<li>Managing the scores via Google doc with the excellent Samantha Ahern is a very good plan. We are each taking a couple of metrics each (selfies with celebrities, etc.).</li>
	<li>Polling tweets with the hashtag is however excellent and is working really well.</li>
	<li>Make sure you know what period your metrics are scoring for and display the weighted</li>

<h2>Sarah Davies from JISC - Chair and Introduction
Spotlight on digital Capabilities event</h2>
#udigcap
<h2>Presentation:
Technology and innovation at the university of Winchester</h2>
<h3>Talking about Digital Literacy at University of Winchester.</h3>
Rebecca JS Nice - a student talking about her experience. Multi-disciplinary degree in Dance and History.
Student Identity and Expectations
- Didn't find much of an outlet to use her iPad in class when she arrived at Uni
- Use of technology was inconsistent
Digital Experience at Winchester - Rebecca became a student fellow.
Student Fellow: an honary-based scheme.
Rebecca became part oar the Mobile Device Scheme
<ul>
	<li>The students were set the task of researching apps and use of mobile technologies in order support instructors who were provided with devices.</li>
	<li>Enjoyed the responsibility of undertaking the research</li>
	<li>The students have an active blog, here it is: <a title=""https://uowmobiledevicescheme.wordpress.com/"" href=""https://uowmobiledevicescheme.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://uowmobiledevicescheme.wordpress.com/</a></li>
	<li>Biggest barrier? Using imagination and motivation, looking at lesson plans and considering ways of using devices</li>
	<li>There were some attitudinal barriers amongst academic staff - worried that devices will be misused. Point is that is you bring the devices into the scope of the class then that is a way of monitoring them and ensuring that they are used to support learning.</li>
	<li>Rebecca has built a website to build an online identity - taking what she is learning on the Mobile Device Scheme and using it support her studies. Here is her site: <a title=""http://www.rebeccajsnice.com/"" href=""http://www.rebeccajsnice.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.rebeccajsnice.com/</a></li>
	<li>She has used blogs to support instructors - used Tumbr as a presentation tool. Asked class and instructors to look her Tumbr during the presentation, linked Tumbr through to Pinterest for added value as part of the project
<ul>
	<li>This was considered a massive risk - so although encouraged - there was concern. Worried about cognitive overload.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Student Barriers?
<ul>
	<li>Confidence - what happens when things go wrong. Consider coping strategies when working with technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Teachers are enthusiastic about the Mobile Device Scheme, but are unsure of how to implement it within their own teaching.
<ul>
	<li>In support of job applications - need to be better links with industry. There should not be technology-based surprises when entering the workforce after studying on a degree
<ul>
	<li>How can we diagnose what employers are looking for and empower our students with career appropriate training?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Amy Barlow - Staff Support perspective - University of Winchester</li>
	<li>Understanding the digital needs of students
<ul>
	<li>Staff have found that the student fellows are really approachable.</li>
	<li>Good point: this generation of students are used to demonstrating/showing technology to their parents and grandparents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Outcomes:
<ul>
	<li>60 student fellow projects per year</li>
	<li>Partnership project on mobile device use across disciplines</li>
	<li>A few example projects
<ul>
	<li>English students introdcue video summaries of modules by tutors to aid module selection</li>
	<li>Law students run peer feedback activity through filming each other in Mock Court Trials</li>
	<li>History students evaluate the use of formative audio feedback</li>
	<li>Student representatives evaluate the use of social media for communcation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Rebecca's recommendations:
<ul>
	<li>Build in Normalisation/routine
<ul>
	<li>Allowing time and opportunity for student research.</li>
	<li>Through sharing projects like student fellows, sharing best-practice. Embedded in their strategy and making sure that it is part of the continuing discourse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Environment
<ul>
	<li>Making the environment tech savvy. Plug and play.</li>
	<li>Working hard to make smart and collaborative spaces available to students</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Digitally dedicated advice services
<ul>
	<li>Yes there is normal tech support. Rebecca thinks it would be good for students to have technology support, as in aspirational tech support! I would like to do this project, what technology can I use? (FM: this was part of the purpose of where I used to work at the Carleton College IdeaLab - it is truly great, particularly when students help students)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Up to date expectations
<ul>
	<li>Technologies will be built into validation. It is essential that expectations are made clear.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3>The 7 Challenge Areas</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There are case studies for each of the areas identified. Dave makes the point that you can build a framework, but what does that look like in terms of small meaningful changes.
<ul>
	<li>We know what we need to do, but it doesn't mean that things that we need to do are easy to get right!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Broadcast mode in Universities - do you know how much email you are actually sending to a student institutionally!</li>
	<li>Mobile devices are becoming centred around notifications - students take ownership of the information that they receive form the university.</li>

I have had a #UX category on this blog for a while, but I have decided to formalise it as I embark on a grad school module, <i>Interaction Design and Evaluation Process. </i>The UX category will be a place to collect my thoughts in relation to what I learn on the module and can be viewed in a collated format via the ""UX"" tab.
Things to comment on this week:
<ul>
	<li>Read and think about <strong>BS EN ISO 9241-210-2010 - Ergonomics of human-system interaction</strong></li>
	<li>Read and comment on user profiles and personae</li>

230,1,20/10/2015 22:41,20/10/2015 22:41,"So to recap, my quest for last week was to look at the following and comment. I did look at the <em>following</em> but this is the first chance that I have had to comment as I have been deeply ensconced in putting some of what I have learned into practice within my IoT research project (sorry, I'm deliberately not providing a lot of detail on the IoT project, just reflecting on what I have learned).
&lt;----the folllowing---!&gt;
<em>- Read and think about <strong>BS EN ISO 9241-210-2010 – Ergonomics of human-system interaction </strong></em>(ISO, 2010).<em>
</em>
<ul>
	<li>I suspect that I shall mainly use the ISO 9241 document as a reference tool. The document itself, in a way, takes the form of several checklists. I particularly like the way that design principles are so neatly summed-up as a helpful list on page 14! The pragmatic advice offered in relation to sources that designers might investigate, when direct contact with users is not possible (pages 16-17), has also been helpful for the IoT project where working with users falls outside the scope. The same will be true of this project, so I really need to get into the mind of my potential users!</li>
</ul>
<em>- Read and comment on user profiles and personae or personas</em>
<ul>
	<li>Since last week I have created 5 draft personas and have started to flesh out three proto personas. The preparatory process of sifting through the user characteristics is time consuming, but it truly does mean that you are covering almost every angle and gaining valuable domain knowledge in the process. My next task is to come up with personas for this project! Which I shall start on in my next post (in draft phase at the moment).</li>
</ul>
<em>- Read and comment on Scenarios</em>
<ul>
	<li>I actually jumped the gun with this one a bit as it is this week's reading (not last weeks). However, I have already been starting to create scenarios for my IoT personas and I am hoping to refine them based on some of the further reading that I do this week on the topic. I found the distinctions made by Lauesen (2005) to be helpful, when considering tasks and scenarios. For example Lauesen (2005) offers the analogy of a hotel; the act of checking in is a ""general case"" as that could apply to any guest; the personification of the act where a named persona checks into a numbers room is a ""case scenario"" and a story which encapsulates both these factors in a real-life situation is a ""vivid scenario"" (p.162). This book is written from a software engineering viewpoint, which may mean that it does not apply in all situations. In the UX Book (2012) I feel like I may have found a new mantra to repeat to myself...""Did it all seem too easy? Did the story seem a little too perfect?"" (p.266).</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Project plan Idea</h2>
One of my tasks for the second session was to come up with a project idea for the module. I have decided to that my project will focus on designing interaction for an Open Educational Resource (OER) in honour of <a title=""Open access week"" href=""http://www.openaccessweek.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Open Access Week</a>, taking place this week (19-25th) Internationally.
My OER will be a self-guided web application for academic staff. The application will take a tour of a typical Blackboard or Moodle course/module and explain how to make study materials as accessible as possible and how to signpost materials to students. The activity will include some quizzing and sorting elements and will focus on presentation and structural considerations. I also think that it would be immensely helpful to simulate how text and colours are seen by say dyslexics or those who are colour blind. I have experimented with this in some of my own programming in the past and it really helped to promote better understanding. Here is my attempt at programming my own dyslexic reading patterns for reference: <a title=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/</a>
If you are interested in seeing some examples of how this might look in the end, here are some of my favourites - although I should say that this project is more of a planning exercise, so it may only ever exist in prototype form.

233,1,25/10/2015 14:51,25/10/2015 14:51,"This post is another entry related to a hypothetical user interface design as part of my study towards an MSc in User Experience Design. <strong>These blog posts should be viewed as rough and reflective and are concerned with a project for a fictional university</strong>.
The first point to clarify is, what exactly is an Open Educational Resource and why would a potential client want to build one? I personally find the following definition from <a title=""Jisc website"" href=""https://www.jisc.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jisc</a> to be the most helpful:
<blockquote>
<p class=""page-title"">Open educational resources are teaching and learning materials that are freely available online for everyone to use, whether you are an instructor, student or self-learner. Examples of OER include: full courses, course modules, syllabi, lectures, homework assignments, quizzes, lab and classroom activities, pedagogical materials, games, simulations, and many more resources contained in digital media collections from around the world.
Jisc, from ""Open educational resources (OERs)"" (<a title=""OER definition"" href=""https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/open-educational-resources"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">direct link</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""page-title"">So the point is that an OER can be almost anything, what distinguishes it is the fact that it is an openly available resource. In the interest of being more specific, from this point forth I shall refer to what I am designing as a learning object; a self-contained learning exercise, which in this case is delivered online from a designated server space or Learning Object repository. This Learning Object will be a basic web application with a ""choose your own adventure"" type learning exercise based on the creation and format of study materials with some interactive gamification elements thrown in. A lot more thinking and development will be required before we can get to that point.</p>
My imagined client for this project is a UK university (enrollment = 20K+) and the intended audience for the Learning Object are their academic staff. The university would like the Learning Object to be openly accessible as it is a mode of publicity (shared via social networks with university branding) and it shows that the university are forward thinking and considering staff professional development and digital capabilities. As the link to the resource will be openly accessible and find-able via search engines, this means that potential users could be anyone with an interest in the accessible presentation of resources, for example: primary school teachers, lecturers, student support tutors, learning technologists, students in teaching training, etc. Potential users could also be anyone who works with a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) or a Learning Management System (LMS) and there are many flavours VLE/LMS on the market. Furthermore users may also come from anywhere in the world, which means that if I wanted to serve all potential users the Learning Object (LO) would need to be available in multiple languages.
The unique paradigm presented by OERs is explained very nicely via metaphor from Jisc - interestingly Jisc also use the consumer and creator definitions, although I came up my definitions independently and found their page after the fact: https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/open-educational-resources/oer-myths

<h2>Hold-up...this is getting really complicated</h2>
However that is not the model that I am going for in this case, the LO is not meant to be all things, to all people; it is for a very specific purpose and that is to help academic staff at a university in the UK gain awareness of different strategies for making learning materials accessible as a response to the forthcoming <a title=""Changes to DSA"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/higher-education-student-support-changes-to-disabled-students-allowances-dsa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">changes to Disabilities Living Allowance</a>. These changes, planned by the current government will take effect halfway through 2016 and may affect the support provisions available to some students in the UK. This LO serves a specific need, for a specific client so is to a certain extent propriatary, the way that we achieve the ""open"" aspect is make the URL accessible to external users outside the university; use metadata to support search engine optimisation; license the underlying code with a <a title=""GNU General Public License 3 info"" href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GNU General Public License 3</a>; and make the source code available via a repository like <a title=""GNA website"" href=""http://gna.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">gna.org</a> which is hosted in France and supports <a title=""Git Version Control"" href=""http://www.git-scm.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">git version control</a> (to comply with <a title=""EU Safe Habour"" href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34442618"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">EU safe harbour ruling</a>).
<h2>On the topic of technical construction...</h2>
Upon consideration of how the Learning Object will be created, I think that it will be a custom coded html5 site with MySQL backing (this is subject to change). A facet of the brief is that data needs to be entered by the user in some way, web applications like <a title=""Xerte"" href=""http://www.xerte.org.uk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Xerte</a> which allow for the fast creation of html5 Learning Objects are not suitable as the resulting LOs seem to be read-only. So although these LOs can be interactive, no data that is entered is actually collected thus the need for a custom solution rather than using an established LO creator application. As the plan is to make the source code publicly reusable this will need to be considered during the construction process, to ensure that there is sufficient documentation to guide those who may wish to reuse the code.
In this model there are two key user groups:
<ul>
	<li>those users from the university who interact with the LO;</li>
	<li>those users from outside the university who interact with the LO.</li>
</ul>
We also need to consider:
<ul>
	<li>those external users who consume first and then move on to create; as in copy and adapt the LO using the source code. These user-creators fall outside the scope of the design for interaction, but should be considered throughout the design and coding stages to ensure that documentation for the code is sufficient and the design allows for future customisation. For example clear image tags and labeling need to be in place to allow any screenshots taken from Moodle or a different VLE to be substituted for the original screenshots taken from Blackboard (see paragraph below).</li>
</ul>
As I mentioned before there are many different VLEs out there, however as we are talking about the UK (and anyone else is welcome to go to town with the content) then the two most prevalent VLEs in the UK are Blackboard and Moodle (UCISA, 2014, p.10). As a consequence, those users who <em>consume</em> will fall into two camps - those with an interest in Blackboard and those with an interest in Moodle; the principles presented in the Learning Object will be the same for each system but the visual aesthetics differ between the two. My client is a university that uses Blackboard, so the LO will be blackboard focused but we hope that someone will create Moodle and other versions in the future based on our source code.
<hr />
<h2>Friday, 6th of November 2015 - Update:</h2>
I have changed my thinking on the LO, as VLEs are updated fairly often this would limit the shelf-life of the LO. It was also proving to be too complex. So I have decided to focus on the idea that I am building one LO, of a hypothetical many, and the LOs are all about the different kind of materials going into the VLE. The LO I am designing will be about creating accessible documents in Microsoft Word. For more on this, see <a title=""Making a game of task decomposition – just in time for Halloween"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/10/29/making-a-game-of-task-decomposition-just-in-time-for-halloween/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this later post</a>.

The design needs to be approachable with goals for the LO clearly outlined. It is quite important that users do not need to login in order to use the LO. A sort of login fatigue is a major issue and some university users may wish to remain anonymous.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;</td>
<td>It would be helpful to track how many academic staff complete the LO, so a potential method for this would be allow the production of a completion certificate at the end of the LO, this will only be generated after the user logs in (using an existing university LDAP easy proxy). Users will have the option to skip the certificate, if they wish to remain anonymous. External users and anon users will still be able to generate a basic completion certificate, but it won't have full university validation (or something along those lines).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Users from the university: students, admin staff, researchers etc.</strong></td>
<td>Although the intended audience are the academic staff at the university and the LO will be clearly labelled as such, other types of university users will not be prevented from accessing the LO.</td>
<td>At the beginning of the LO the users will be asked to type in their role which will auto-populate an entry cell based on a predefined set of options. E.g. What is your role? I am... offer a drop-down list (e.g. a student; a researcher, an administrator etc.) and autocomplete, if ""other"" is selected then they will be asked to specify. In order to gain some basic usage stats, users will be asked to self-identify whether they work/study at the client university (to differentiate between internal and external users). This data will not be completely accurate as people may forget to self-identify or an external user may incorrectly identify, however it will give an indication of use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Users external to the university</strong></td>
<td>External users will have access to the LO. These users could come from anywhere in the world and English may not be their first language.</td>
<td>
As login is not required to use the LO, any entry fields must be validated to ensure that malicious code cannot be entered in the LO.
The option for a basic certificate, where the external users enter their preferred name and a PDF is generated for download needs to be available.
Write the LO in <a title=""plain english campaign"" href=""http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">plain English</a>, this will help all users.
Where specific technical terms are used, provide a glossary and/or rollover definitions as technical terms differ per country.</td>

<td><strong>Remote</strong></td>
<td>Technologist/s responsible for monitoring the use of the LO needs a way to download usage data. These users are also support users.</td>
<td>Require access to a basic online dashboard showing how many academic staff per department/school have completed the LO. Counts of other users should also be included in the dashboard and an option to download the data as a .csv.</td>
<td>
It would be ideal for this data to be displayed as a leader board; a graph showing the top school through to the bottom school. However this is really out-of-scope, as that is a separate application. It would be nice to show users school stats after they have logged in for their certificate. E.g. you are 1 of 48 people in Computing who have completed the LO. Computing is now the 2nd most engaged school. However if robust .csv export features are added visualisations could be produced periodically in Excel and other programs and the leader board could be added at a later stage.
Any more complex anonymous data about visitors to the LO should be reviewed through Google Analytics.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Collateral</strong></td>
<td>Those accessing derivative versions of the LO via  third-party repositories.</td>
<td>
The LO may loose some value in its iterations and therefore when it is placed in repositories by third-parties, the owners of these repositories may not want it to be there.
The client university's branding graphics will not be included with the source code, as it needs to be clear that derivatives are not still owned/maintained by the university.</td>

Validate all data entered into the LO according to set parameters; disallow html tags and certain words/characters.

In early June I had the pleasure of implementing a conference-wide gamification activity in support of the <a href=""http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/groups/dsdg/Events/2015/digcaps.aspx"">UCISA Digital Capabilities</a> event. The event took place at MediaCity, Salford; a vibrant and engaging venue for an event stocked-full of innovative ideas. The event focused on showcasing successful practices for supporting academic staff and learners in their use of technology within further and higher education. Another goal of the event was to highlight findings from the recent <a href=""http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/%7E/media/groups/dsdg/usg/Digital_Capabilities_Executive_Summaryv6.ashx"">Digital Capabilities survey</a>. So when a member of the event organising committee, Iain Cameron (University of Aberdeen, and UCISA Digital Capabilities committee), mentioned the idea of a Twitter selfie (or Twelfie) competition as part of the proceedings; Rise immediately came to my mind as the right tool for the job! I had encountered Rise before at a demo at the International Confex event in 2013 and then again during the Mahara 2014 Hui held at the University of Brighton.

248,1,23/10/2015 10:39,23/10/2015 10:39,"Gary Finnegan from Turnitin - he prioritises new features for the Blackboard plugins
They have moved to an Agile, Scrum development and project management frameworks.
They are taking apart the plugins at the moment and rebuilding, in order to make
<strong>Key issues</strong>
<strong>Basic</strong>
Account migration (self-managed hosting)
Email non-submitters feature wasn't working - now fixed since the slide was created
Reminder of the change to the URL post-Jisc so that means upgrade is necessary.
<strong>NEXT</strong>
Basic ---> NEXT will be installed over the top
Direct ---> there will be a way to migrate to NEXT but it will be harder
Basic to Direct ----> best to stay with what you have got as they will not be a way to migrate the data between the two. Support will continue for plugins until everyone is migrated to NEXT.
<strong>Blackboard versions</strong>
<strong>Supported:</strong>
Learn 9.1 Self hosted (SP14 April and October)
Learn 9.1 Managed Hosted (SP14 April and October)
</strong>Working to support:</strong>
Ultra, tricky due to lack of building blocks, however they are currently working Blackboard.
Turnitin Next will have multiple marker function. Once they build multiple instructors into the core product then multiple instructions will be better in the iPad app. Group submission support will also be part of Tii Next. These are early release features. It doesn't sound like anonymous marking for groups will be supported though.
The support on the plugins will not end, this contradicts the Tii website. They are working on resolving this issue on their website and making sure that the information represents reality.

Tentative road map
<strong>Audience questions:</strong>
The issues with the Office365 online file type submissions should be resolved now as Microsoft have altered the way that they make .docx files (after originally causing the issues by changing the way that they made docx files). The download and then upload is the best option, they are looking at cloud submit options (hard to implement technically).
Rubric sharing will also be easier in Next!
Moving towards LTI, they are working with Blackboard to extend the functionality marking sure that the marks go back to the grade Centre (not always consistent at the moment).
The plugin will also get BETA accounts for the plugin - this will be sent to account admins.
They are changing their release policy so, there will be more frequent release. The roadmap looks a little bit abrupt, but there will be overlap and any migration will be phased and coordinated for quite periods. They are working on communication. Will Murray will talk about it more in his presentation.
<strong>Next up - Company Update from Will Murray - Tii CPO</strong>
Will encourages us all to email him directly and has business cards available.
<strong>Access</strong>
<strong>Accuracy</strong>
<strong>Answers</strong>
<strong>Additions</strong>
The underlying technology is over 10 years old and this has presented challenges for change. It is a heritage pre-cloud solution with cloud demands. They built their own file system, this was amazing back then, not so great now.
Rapid change has been hindered by this - however they are still effective.

Stats show that the implementation of Turnitin leads to a reduction in plagiarism
<strong>LESSONS LEARNED</strong>
last year they were aquifer by Insight Venture Partners - see it as a best in class system, but has some underlying technology that needs an update. So they have put in a lot of investment. They have brought in new Executive Leadership: Marc Daubach - Corporate VP (formerly Exlibris), Bobby Wilson CFO, Ron Park CTO specialises in highly available knowledge and emergency notifications. He has spearheaded the move to Agile Scrum. Elijah Mayfield, leading researcher in machine learning (VP New Technologies). Will is the only one to remain in the executive.
Steph Butler is their director of User Experience, they have never had a UX lead before. Her specialism is ethnographic research with instructors, they are in the process of building out their UX team. They are implementing the minimum requirements derived from the ethnographic research.
Jess Wells, Principal Product Manager - Integrations - she is working on the LTI move. Everyone is moving towards the cloud.
They would like to have much less of other people's code to manage!
What all of us want is for their code on their cloud servers, not code that has to be schlepped to Blackboard and implemented. This is the long-range plan. This should make testing easier.
Holder Beuger - Director of Customer Service - he is taking all control of all the product support
New Technology - Turnitin have acquired Netherlands plagiarism detection company Ephorus - they bought those developers in
They also bought Moss (Measure of Software Similarity) - this does plagiarism detection in software engineering. They have the software now and have a project planned to look at integrating into Turnitin in January. Will ship it initially as standalone solution for those who want to use it on the command line.
Another acquisition - LightSide from Pittsburgh, USA.
Machine learning technology. LightSide have managed to create positive marking feedback which is automated. You can go in and edit the text unlike other automatic rubric marking solutions.
<strong>Significant Reorganisation</strong>
They have kept the Ephorus office in Utrecht.
New office in Melbourne
Single web team and the are looking to address the communication issues, as no longer the responsibility of individual country-based offices.
Product focus - Product team expansion, move to Product Ownership, focus on user experience.
Access: Reliability
<ul>
	<li>significant investment</li>
	<li>expanded engineering by 28%</li>
	<li>expanded product management by 68%</li>
	<li>New architecture and Instrumentation</li>
	<li>Heritage retirement program</li>
</ul>
They are retiring the instructor dashboard due to system load and lack of use.
<strong>Accuracy</strong>
57billion - Web Pages
143million - STM Journals
570million - Essays
26million - students
They are developing a new crawler - deeper crawl (they are going to crawl JavaScript to to look at PDFs hidden behind script), UK and US dbs.
<strong>Answers</strong>
Better triage and better routing for user tickets.
They have implemented new telephony system, they want to provide better self-service help for students.
To do: Human Responses they are looking to build solutions into the product, so that responses/solutions are available in the interface rather than having it in the
Customer Satisfaction survey now in place, after support terms.
Expanded Success by 22%
Customer Success Roles
Tier-2 Support Roles
Product change - fixing password resets, so that a ticket isn't required.
<strong>Answers</strong>
Self service - Jules Sunderland
YES - working on customised downloadable manuals!
This is being implemented at: guides.turnitin.com
Help desk revamp
<strong>EULA & SLA project</strong>
They are working on providing the option for universities to agree a EULA and update student agreements locally, rather than the individual students having to accept the EULA. They are working on the legal requirements for this.
Hoping to embed help tickets into Blackboard and Moodle and have better way of gathering system information. They will require a new building block.
<strong>Additions</strong>
Questions: they want calls to come to the institution rather than going to Turnitin. They want a call logging system. Need insight into the kind of calls which are logged.
Integrations students will NOT have access to the self-service. The help desk will redirect integrations students back to local help desks.
Will - from a staff perspective it will be helpful to raise the ticket from within the new plugin and auto-generate the system information needed by Tii support.
They will allow these features to turned on and off.
Transition to Scrum - they were locked into a waterfall process before with Waterfall you end up spending months writing the specifications, by which time they are out of date.
They are now working on two-week iterations.
- they are at the point with the iPad team, blackboard team and Moodle team. The backend stuff and some other teams who are transitioning.
60 engineers have been trained in Scrum certification.
12 product owners trained
New UX team

Talking about processing large cohorts worth of work.
<ul>
	<li>improve through revision</li>
	<li>promote original writing</li>
	<li>assess student progress</li>
	<li>evaluate and deliver personalised feedback</li>
</ul>
Machine marking is the future, they will evaluate the marking of say 500 essay marking and then create an engine to automatically mark papers. If the marking is not consistent for the engine to pick up then they will use a company to mark the papers with moderation and second blind. FM: is anyone else worried by this?
<strong>Roadmap themes</strong>
Will Murray - Chief Product Officer
<strong>accessibility</strong>
Now have a clear accessibility statement on the website
New Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) with the Paciello Group
Request auditing EV July
Teams have been  accessibility trained.
<strong>what's next?</strong>
Looking at embedding tags for accessible readers - better access to assessment manager. They are concentrating on the student view from this angle.
<strong>iPad app</strong>
V1.4.0 April 25
Mark Criteria Association
Planned:
Sync improvements
Password and login improvements
Next:
Touch ID support
Android investigation
Student app
<strong>Revision system - note that this has always been a separate product, but more of it will come into Tii in the future</strong>
<ol>
	<li>They develop a prompt library - this is aimed at secondary ed not higher ed (phew, but it is coming)</li>

- main points, a more student centric originality report, do not look at text which we do not expect to be plagiarised
Plagiarism detection
There will be a crawler console, so that you can review which sites have been crawled and when. Also javascript crawl of PDFs in open access will happen.
Personalised feedback
Enhanced UI and Formatting
Peer assessment
Group work and individual extensions
Non integer grades and multiple graders
Revision signals in GM
---they have acquired a grammar company--- they are turning it into a web tool for revision assistant and Tii. Available for US and UK English.
Evaluate Progress - they want to say hey you've just graded 400 essays, now we can grade them for you with a pen algorithm in GradeMark.
Aspirational plan - it is subject to change

Quarter 1 - aspire to get the student iPad out
Data dump reporting is coming, so that we can do our own in depth analysis. Craig and Fiona can go to town with the data!!!
Using coloured marks for multiple evaluators
Decimal and Non Integer grades
Multiple graders / double blind is a ways out.
Individual extensions is coming a lot sooner!

Interface comparison
Bubble comments will have formatting available.
E-rater, GradeMark and originality has better overlay with checkbox options to turn them on.
Contextual text comments are STILL blue italic. - I will ask about that
Rubrics will be sliders.
They may be introducing a read-only layer for external examiner view.
You can opt in a secondary account on the BETA so that you can choose how and when users get access to NEXT.

LIVE IN 2017 folks!
We're watching a trailer now I am not going to hold up iPad and record it like everyone else!
There will be a hyperlink tool in the bubbles.
turnitin-beta@turnitin.com - write to them to be on the waiting list as we couldn't get on this, I think.

Video presentation from Elijah Mayfield
Talking about changes to revision assistant
LightSide labs out of CarnegieMellon
Focusing on students improving as writers. As students are working on their essay they can receive feedback on their essay, this feedback does not compete with the instructors feedback.
The technology looks beyond word count, grammar and spelling. Looking at content analysis, high level goals related to assessment criteria.
Version control, each time a student requests feedback a snapshot of a draft is taken.
Instructors can review all the drafts, thus they can choose to mark all of the versions.
Piloted this spring in the US
14-15 year old students drafted their papers on average 11 times, an increase over the normal teacher-student model.
High school students drafted 8 times.
They have seen an improvement in the papers according to criteria between drafts.
They are not going to evaluate creativity writing.
They would like volunteer institutions in the UK to be early adopters so that they can gear to the product. For each writing prompt --> they need to gather hundreds papers - so data mining.
Questions about revision assistant
Very controversial, but Will assures that it is not to replace instructor feedback it is to allow drafts which are rated according to criteria. Drafts aren't currently supported so it is adding functionality.

Evaluation viewer - is mainly a face lift so they think onboarding is sufficient. The assignment manager will be far more drastic, they will send tutorial videos.
Brief or the ability to exclude sections - this is a features request
Grading other media types - at this point they are not going to add support for other media types. Spec move and audio.
User voice system - Domi makes the point that the features voting is limited as features sit in the queue for years...Will: hopefully with agile
Tii use word to render documents, so if can be seen in Word then it should be rendered in Tii. Can hyperlinks be made active? It is an image not a PDF they would have to overlay the hyperlink over the picture.
Multiple files or multiple drafts - are what they are working on.
Student ID integration is on the roadmap.
Fiona question: Are you going to handle the EU Safe Habour Ruling more adequately by providing EU data centres? - following EU guidelines. Umbrella agreement watching the EC guidelines. <strong>Please add updates about this to your communication thread. </strong>Another audience member asked, so are UK papers accessed in the US system - yup!

343,1,29/10/2015 17:39,29/10/2015 17:39,"An eventful week! Upon considering how to best design the Learning Object for a hypothetical client university, I decided to start by looking at the prospective tasks to be completed in the interface (and beyond). I took this route as I was pondering personae and realised that without tasks, in this particular case it felt like a chicken and egg situation. As a result of this process, I now feel more able to come up with robust personae based on each of the groups identified in my <a title=""User characteristics are coming out of my ears"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/10/20/user-characteristics-are-coming-out-of-my-ears/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">earlier post</a> (<a title=""Characteristics for – Users from the client university: academic staff"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/characteristics-for-users-from-the-university-academic-staff/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">academic staff</a>, <a title=""Characteristics for – Users from the client university: students, admin staff, researchers etc."" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/characteristics-for-users-from-the-client-university-students-admin-staff-researchers-etc/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">students/other staff</a>, <a title=""Characteristics for – Users external to the client university"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/characteristics-for-users-external-to-the-client-university/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">external</a> and <a title=""Characteristics for – Support users from the client university"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/characteristics-for-support-users-from-the-client-university/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">support</a>), so I will build those next on pages in this blog.
On a related note, yesterday I attended the first ever Brighton Gamification meet-up. The event had a focus on the use of gaming strategies in sports wearable IoT systems. Bearing in mind that my other project is looking at <em>sports wearable devices </em>and the systems they reside in, this could not have been more apropos!
For full details of the event, including the list of speakers, see the meetup.com page: <a title=""http://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Gamification-Meetup/events/225063072/"" href=""http://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Gamification-Meetup/events/225063072/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Gamification-Meetup/events/225063072/</a>
<h3>Key points and observations from the event</h3>
<strong>Paul Nuki - CEO of</strong> <a title=""StepJockey - how it works"" href=""https://www.stepjockey.com/how-it-works"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">StepJockey (a fitness app)</a>
<ul>
	<li>Recommended the MINDSPACE project as a resource. MINDSPACE was the result of a research project commissioned by the UK government in 2010. It features pragmatic advice about how to implement gamification strategies. As Paul said, some of the recommendations as part of MINDSPACE, seem obvious but they can be very helpful to use as a check-list when working on any gamified project. <a title=""Gamified UK link"" href=""http://www.gamified.uk/2015/04/27/mindspace-influencing-behaviour/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Here is a bit more information</a> about MINDSPACE from the gamified UK site. As a side note, a nice feature of the gamified UK site, is that that they include an estimation of how long it will take to read the post (e.g. ""1 minutes (ish)"" sic). I need to make sure that I include this in my interface design, so that it is clear how long each activity will take.</li>
	<li>If you haven't heard of StepJockey before, check out the signs on the stairs in Watts Building at Moulsecoomb campus; someone has already <a title=""Rate a staircase"" href=""https://www.stepjockey.com/Stairs/Rate/Add"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">rated our staircase</a>. It is such a good idea!</li>
	<li>Another point that Paul made is that when it comes to engaging in corporate wellness programmes and fitness initiatives people are often time poor (don't have time to engage), skills poor (in this instance, not accomplished at a sport, thus climbing stairs, although <a title=""Empire State Building Runup"" href=""http://www.esbnyc.com/event/2015-empire-state-building-run-up-info"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">that can be a sport</a>) or self-conscious. It occurs to me that these same conditions apply to learning about technology and ultimately what is the incentive, as it isn't like you become more svelte as a result of doing it. One to dwell on.</li>
	<li>Paul also suggested some good strategies to deal with awarding prizes. Apparently material prizes work best, but all prizes skew behaviours (brilliantly outlined by Daniel Pink (2010) in his book <em>Drive</em>, which I devoured recently). This will be tricky as material prizes are hard to provide in an academic environment, however I think that random or 'spot prizes' have a lot of potential and could be awarded based on certain types of engagement with the system and delivered via email.</li>
	<li>When I have run gamification activities, there is a tendency for a 'top of the class' factor to emerge. This is when a small group of people, who are highly competitive accrue a large amount of points in a small amount of time leading to the disenfranchisement of other competitors. Paul had some good suggestions to counteract this issue, such as putting these people into their own super leagues (which may not be visible to other users). Also, you can personalise messaging and views of their data, focusing on the positive for users who tend to be less engaged. Furthermore, he suggested rewarding consistency and the idea of making the 'top of the class' players ""champions"" to encourage others. Finally, I will take heed of his advice that small teams work better than big ones, so perhaps my plan of having people contribute to their school score is too abstract. What about a by-campus building score instead?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Toby Beresford - CEO of RISE.global</strong>
<ul>
	<li>I have used the RISE leaderboard tool recently (see <a title=""Re-Blog: Reflections on using Rise to support conference-based gamification"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/10/24/reflections-on-using-rise-to-support-conference-based-gamification/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">blog post</a> for details) and found it to be very helpful in a situation where you want to define your own metrics and create an enticing leaderboard.</li>
	<li>I found Toby's thoughts on the subject of using scoring dashboards particularly insightful. The highlights...
<ul>
	<li>Toby's working definition of dashboards: ""Engaging, actionable feedback that triggers timely, behaviour change.""
<ul>
	<li>So dashboards can be used to:
<ul>
	<li>Learn something new, or</li>
	<li>Get better at something we already do</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>What is the business objective? This is where Toby made an excellent point: managers measure and players/coaches keep score. How can I emphasize this in the design? It is about self-betterment and group-bettement; not keeping tabs on people.</li>
	<li>Reward strategies: as Toby said (and this is another thing that I learned from reading Drive), rewards can turn play into work. So micro rewards are the way to go. Also he showed the example of Nike+ app, which unlike other gamification apps has no rewards or badges; I had never noticed this in the years when I was an avid fan of Nike+!</li>
	<li>Who do I compare myself with? This is a crucial question. I prefer a measure, like a mark, or a grade with clear criteria rather than a straightforward comparison between people. Toby showed a dashboard with a single score and I really like this idea, because I think that it mitigates the possibility of cognitive overload brought on by too may dials/measures/stats.</li>
	<li>Then most importantly, the distribution channels for the dashboard need to be thought through. If people want to share their scores, how do they do that? If people are doing well or need encouragement how do you stimulate engagement so that they come back to the board, or the activity, with which it is associated? The key is multichannel distribution and getting the balance right.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hierarchical Task Breakdown: What Fiona did...</h2>
I believe in learning from ones mistakes and so I have kept my initial hierarchical task breakdown below. When I first published this post, I declined to notice that the numbering system of the task list below had not worked properly in the saved version. However upon noticing this and attending class last Friday, I also noticed that I hadn't completed the breakdown correctly and was making this WAY too complicated for myself again! In fact each of the topics listed below would make a good learning object on their lonesome. When I reviewed the user personae that I have created (see a future post) I noticed that the common denominator was that all the users would definitely need to create documents (academic staff, other staff, students, external and even support staff). This helped to re-focus my efforts on the design of a learning object dedicated to creating accessible Word documents. Simple yes, but a nice structured place to start.
-------------What I did--------------
So bearing all of this in mind, I have come up with a task plan below, starting from a future menu page in the learning object. The main question for those who engage is... ""What would you like to learn about first?"".
NB. Steps in <span style=""color: #808080;"">grey</span> occur outside the Learning Object

<h2>What Fiona did next...</h2>
I went back to the drawing board and created the new hierarchical task breakdown below. This is based on Task Scenarios, which I have added to <a title=""Task Scenarios as of 04/11/15"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/task-scenarios-as-of-041115/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this page for reference</a> (although I anticipate further edits of these documents further down the line).

I have a confession to make, I am pretty perplexed by Unified Modeling Language (UML). If you were to look at this blog, based on the lack of posts, you wouldn't think that I had made any progress over the past two weeks. We covered User Conceptual Modeling as a topic in class back on the 6th of November and in my last post on the 11th, I made the grand proclamation that I would complete my UML diagram by Friday (13th). Well I did create a UML diagram, and then I created another iteration and another; I became obsessed with understanding the syntax...not a healthy obsession, but a frustrating one.
During the past week I tried to read everything that I could in order to aid my understanding. Tonight I came to the realisation that Learning Objects are pretty hard to build in UML. I also made the decision to leave this part of the project for now and move on to writing some commentary on user requirements. I feel that by moving on, I may miss some error in the system design, but also if I continue to work on the diagram I am going to stall my progress further. This was paralleled early on in the other project that I am working on at the moment, where I attempted to create a diagram for a hypothetical wearable device as part of the Internet of Things. Four-plus iterations later I finally have something that resembles the operation of a real system.
To summarise here is what I have learned from this road-block:
<ul>
	<li>step <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">away</span> from the diagram;</li>
	<li>perspective can only be capitalised upon by making some space between yourself and the problem and then walking back towards it;</li>
	<li>Make like Andy Warhol, and iterate;</li>
	<li>Allow for frustration time - cook on a medium heat and allow to simmer.</li>
</ul>
Until next time...

<h2>1.1 Purpose</h2>
<strong>The problem (in one sentence):</strong>
Changes to support-related funding for disabled students necessitates the need to increase academic staff knowledge of best practices involving technology to support disabled students.</blockquote>
Well I have been working away on a number of things and they ARE starting to resemble a whole, which is encouraging. For a while there, I felt like I was in a sort of limbo struggling to see the connections between my activities.
I decided to start work on the concept document. I looked at a few different documentation standards, however I finally settled on adapting the NASA software documentation standard(NASA-STD-2100-91, 1991). The activity of starting to pull together some of the project background information, as previously explored on this blog, in-writing has been really helpful. That work is summarised in the <em>problem</em> sentence above. The idea of producing a sentence-long summary is influenced by LEAN principles as applied to UX (Gothelf, 2013, p.20), although not having an original interactive system that I being commissioned to replace it is more about having a succinct statement to sum-up why what I am designing is important.
Furthermore, I decided that it was time to look back through the characteristics, hierarchical task breakdown and task scenarios in order to check for any inconsistencies and as a means to validate aspects of my UML diagram. I identified a number of naming differences that are now revised and standardised conventions have been established across the design artifacts. The main realisation about the hypothetical Learning Object (for university-x; a fictional university) was that for a tool with the primary goal of promoting accessibility, there was no accessibility built into its interaction. Part of offering responsive accessibility options is allowing the user to specify their needs and I realised that this needed to feature in both the tasks and the interaction design for new users entering the Learning Object. This is now included and reflected in the UML diagram below (version 5).
Another realisation, also on the accessibility front, was that I had previously stated that PDF guides would be made available, related to each of the Learning Topic quizzes in the Learning Object. I noticed that I had not included an interaction to allow for the download of 'said' PDFs. Another aspect that was missing, was the gamification element which I had so painstakingly thought about during the characteristics phase. Due to the constraints of the project, these features cannot be sophisticated, however <em>some</em> features should still be there! Namely there was no ending to the learning object and I conceived that staff would be expecting some kind of conclusion, however basic. Therefore I have included a finale, which will feature <em>number of participants per school</em> and <em>school rank</em>. Very basic, but it may motivate users in university-x to encourage colleagues to take part in order to promote their place on this leader board. For non-university-x users then the finale will be a simple ""thank you"" page.
Now I need to get back to the requirements and wireframing, but I had to get that stuff out of the way first. As previously mentioned, I think that I have realised that Learning Objects are fairly hard to design from scratch as there are some built-in expectations about how they work and how users interact with them. On the one hand it is good, as the user knows what they are getting with a leaning object, the same way they do when buying their favourite brand of cereal. On the other it is fairly constraining from a design perspective as it means that there are certain things that need to be included even if they feel redundant (the user marking completion of activities for example; this is pretty essential as it unlocks or allows progression to other areas of the LO, but it feels like it should be automated). Also this activity has really helped me to think about structural aspects of all eLearning systems, which very often seem more like vessels for a collection of functionality rather than unified products. This Learning Object is no different, the illusion of cohesion will be the mission of design; such a large proportion of educating is about design.

I was, of course working on my Learning Object project during this time (and you thought I was slacking!) however, for the most part I have to admit to reverting to paper reflections for a while, due to sheer convenience. Currently my notes are collectively living on bits of scrap-paper, serviettes/napkins, and evernote entries. I plan to pull them together here over the next few days, a process that I have started with the inclusion of <a title=""Real-time reflection: experience of completing a Learning Object"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/20/real-time-reflection-experience-of-completing-a-learning-object/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">my reflection of using a learning object as an end user</a>, I will include more on that later in the post.
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>First a few relevant reflections from my experience working on 12 Apps of Christmas</strong></span>
After the course we ran a completion survey. Although there is only a small number of responses so far (11 respondents out of 192 course subscribers; survey is open until the end of January), the responses do correlate with some of the observations that I had made. As the course was designed as an opportunity for academic staff, the insights into that population are helpful as I move forward with the Learning Object design, that is geared to the same community.
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><em>Course subscribers really appreciated clear image-based instructions with accompanying step-by-step written annotation.</em></span>
Commentary:
This could inform aspects of user documentation for the Learning Object. Specifically, the idea to include accompanying PDF guides for topics is supported by this anecdotal evidence.

Commentary:
We had a structure of 12+ exercises due to the preexisting structure of the 12 apps course, but interest did drop-off sharply after the 4th day (1 exercise per day). However, when considering a learning object this would seem like a pertinent observation. Also the topic of the learning object is probably (lets be honest) less interesting than learning about mobile apps presented with a festive theme.

<em><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Beware of the inverse Field of Dreams (1989) effect...If you build it, they won't necessarily come</span> </em>
Commentary:
Getting as much web traffic as we did took major effort: building and maintaining the blog where we delivered the content; promoting the content via Twitter and keeping to our self-imposed publishing deadlines. In spite of this effort, the traffic dropped off after the 4th day, as documented in the screenshot from the site analytics above. I think that it is important to admit that learning resource content and therefore the Learning Object that I am designing has a very limited shelf-life, both in the sense of consumable shelf-life and continued relevance. This does not undermine the reusable goal of the Learning Object and it's Open Education ethos, but it does mean that it is more of a reusable template as opposed to being completely reusable in and of itself. I think that best way of considering the reuse aspect is that this Learning Object can be reused through a simple hyperlink to it, but is not geared towards being part of a open learning object repository (it would continue to live with the client university, university-x). Furthermore with my learning technologist hat on, driving traffic to the learning object would require a clearly structured publicity plan so that it was viewed as a timely tool in relation to the changes to DSA funding. Finally, this point really speaks to the importance of the delivery environment and how it portrays the importance of the Learning Object. As the Learning Object is academic staff-focused it is not best placed within the Virtual Learning Environment, a more centralised site with a focus on learning and teaching guidance at the fictional client university may be more appropriate. This will help to ensure that our main target audience have ready access and memorable access.
So this is the spot in my thought process where I revised the purpose <strong>sentence</strong> slightly, as it wasn't quite right:
<blockquote>Changes to funding for support of disabled students, necessitates the need to increase academic staff knowledge of best practices involving technology, to help disabled students and to fill areas of deficit created by the reduction of funding.</blockquote>
The act of doing this resulted in a crucial thought:
This Learning Object is to promote awareness of DSA and accessible practices. How on earth did it end up being about Microsoft Word? I realised that by narrowing the scope, as my prior ideas were too expansive for the project prescribed by my instructor, I also undermined the purpose of the Learning Object. However, I was relieved to realise that this was largely a matter of semantics and learning content rather than an issue that would affect the ""structure plane"" (Garrett, 2011) of the Learning Object.
To summarise, the Learning Object will still focus on accessibility in documents but this will be presented alongside information about DSA and increasing awareness of different student needs, so the new provisional title is: <em>Making your documents accessible. </em>The only aspects that still look at software-based techniques are the guidance PDFs and the <em>offline exercise,</em> which are easier for university-x support staff to update independently and then add new versions to the Learning Object's back-end storage. Another thought that I had in relation to this point, is that learning video repositories like Lynda.com might be provided at university-x, so software training in my Learning Object would be a <em>poor relation</em> when compared to the quality of such repositories. Therefore the key features that set the Learning Object apart are the bite-sized and context specific learning topics, the option to complete it anonymously and its enhanced accessibility. The Learning Object may also be more approachable for users who find the vast choice of videos that are available in a service like Lynda.com to be overwhelming as a starting point.
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Other major discoveries</strong></span>
After I undertook my reflection of using a learning object (post: <a title=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/20/real-time-reflection-experience-of-completing-a-learning-object/"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/20/real-time-reflection-experience-of-completing-a-learning-object/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/20/real-time-reflection-experience-of-completing-a-learning-object/</a>), I decided to take a shot at sketching some wireframes based on v5 of my UML model diagram (see this post: <a title=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/</a>). However, as soon as I started to do it my fears were realised and it became clear that I would need to revise the scenarios and then change the UML model diagram accordingly. This was a lot of extra work, but worth doing as it is important to me that I create something that hopefully equals or improves upon existing Learning Objects.
Here is my first shot at sketching around about 20th of December:
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/featuredpost1-2b0dvmx.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-468"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/featuredpost1-2b0dvmx.png"" alt=""wireframe sketches 1"" width=""800"" height=""575"" /></a>
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">As a result of this I decided to:</span>
<ol>
	<li>I removed one of the Topics, <em>Readability. </em>As it would be covered in <em>Fonts &amp; Legibility</em> and was redundant. It would also add to the time that it would take to complete the Learning Object and this cannot exceed 30mins (a usability requirement).</li>
	<li>Removed <em>view feedback</em> from the Topics as feedback is built into the proceedings of a learning activity - previously called <em>Quiz</em> and then later <em>Lesson</em> in the UML iterations.</li>
	<li>Established the use of a learning activity, based ""programmed instruction"" as defined in the IMS Learning Design Specification (2003a, 2003b). This model features questions, presented alongside information; these will take the form of multiple choice questions with built-in feedback. This is based on an established design pattern outlined in the IMS LDS (2003b, Section 4.1, para. 1).</li>
	<li>I have worked on standardising the language within the scenarios and Learning Object in the wake of what I have learned through study of the IMS Design Specification.</li>
	<li>I added a centralised topic index page. I had something like this very early on, but it became clear to me after I worked though a Learning object myself that users need a clear overview of the contents of the learning object from the get-go. This also displays the test and certificate, although not available immediately, to give users an idea of the narrative flow of the proceedings as well as the internal end goal; obtaining the certificate.</li>
	<li>I added a glossary as a global component of the Learning Object. This was based on a needs from the user characteristics that I had not picked up on for users external to university-x. I also felt frustrated by the lack of a glossary when I was using a Learning Object as a user.</li>
	<li>I added settings and help as a global component of the Learning Object. This is based on the ideas from my <a title=""“Bits &amp; Pieces Put Together to Present a Semblance of a Whole”"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">earlier post</a>, when I felt that use of the accessibility settings needed to be built into the task scenarios.</li>
	<li>Having quizzes for each topic, no longer made sense and as an incentivizing measure I added a central test that becomes available once the three main topics are completed.</li>
	<li>The introduction became a <em>tutorial</em> rather than <em>slides</em>. Slides were too visually prescriptive and I want to provide a step-by-step guide so that users can learn how to use the interface quickly.</li>
	<li>Plus there is the glaringly obvious oversight... in addition to the normal objectives of software this Learning Object requires Learning Outcomes. <strong>This is the reason why I am no longer referring to the Learning Object as LO, as this is a common shortening for Learning Outcomes in educational terminology and may lead to confusion.</strong></li>
	<li>I took out task scenario 2 where the user could return to the saved Learning Object via a hyperlink in an email. This is not great practice as it encourages behaviour on the part of the user that could lead to them becoming victims of phishing in the future (Van Duyne, Landay, &amp; Hong, p.555). The solution is to provide a clear link to a university domain parent page, rather than a user-specific URL and instruct the user to copy and paste the parent URL into the web browser address bar.</li>
</ol>
After all this, I ended up with the following - I feel MUCH more positive about this as the structure makes more sense.

<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>A few notes about IMS LDS </strong></span>
I have mixed feelings about my discovery of the IMS Learning Design Specification. I came across it as I searched the ALT (Association of Learning Technologists) wiki, as I was curious what standards and specifications exist for Learning Technologies as these technologies have been around for a long time. Initially I came across information on Educational Modelling Language, which has folded into the IMS standard (original information from the ALT wiki: <a title=""ALT wiki link"" href=""http://wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/Learning_objects_and_repositories#Systems_and_processes_for_sharing_Learning_Objects"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/Learning_objects_and_repositories#Systems_and_processes_for_sharing_Learning_Objects</a>)
On the one-hand the specifications feature learning design patterns, which are immensely valuable to this project and also within my day job. The specifications also include a very comprehensive outline of the XML metadata requirements that are needed to create a Learning Object that is truly reusable and also searchable; the following article some some good annotation of the XML to demonstrate the metadata properties (Ragbir &amp; Mohan, 2009). However, as a specification it is too complex for this project, so as much as I would like to create a perfect learning object, in order to be compliant with the standard I would need to start from scratch and create something with multiple roles (student and support) and far more complex taxonomies. I also looked into whether I could adapt it and use it as a documentation standard, as a perhaps more appropriate alternative to the NASA documentation standard (1991), however as I started to map the necessary concepts over the contents page and  it became clear that would not be possible within the scope of this project.

It didn't go well (screenshot from 2003a).[/caption]
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>So what am I going to use from IMS LDS?</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>I have tried my best to use the language outlined in the IMS LDS as this will provide a common way to describe the processes, architecture and learning design using terminology that is understood in my professional field.</li>
	<li>I will reference some of the learning design patterns (as found in Section 2. Use Cases in 2003b) as they are very helpful and provided some positive validation of the work that I had done so far, in terms of the structural make-up of a Learning Object.</li>
	<li>I absolutely love the stage-play metaphor that the IMS LDS standard uses to explain a learning object. In short a Unit of Learning (UoL), as defined in the standard, is a package that includes the learning content, including code and physical files alongside the specified metadata. This content is ""played"" and is compatible with different delivery ""environments"". The actions or method within the UoL are a series of ""Plays"". Those plays are structured as ""acts"" and within the acts the ""Roles"" perform their requisite ""activities"" within the ""environment"" (2003b, Section 3.2.3). The most succinct description of the standard that I have found is a PowerPoint presentation by researchers from the University of Vienna, Introduction to IMS Learning Design (Derntl, Neumann, &amp; Oberhuemer, 2009).</li>
	<li>Having looked at the NASA software documentation standard (1991) again I felt that an adapted version of the IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications (1998) will actually be more suitable in terms of outlining the final concept document. This standard has more common group with the IMS LDS.</li>
</ul>
As for the ""minor anguish"" of this post's title, as you can tell from the my writing above, discoveries have resulted in substantial work and with limited time available this has certainly led to a certain level of anguish. This was largely due to the need to back-track in certain areas. However, I now feel that I am almost back on-track, with the aim of completing my wireframes before the Christmas holiday is out.

467,1,20/12/2015 10:00,20/12/2015 10:00,"As part of my day job, I had to complete a Learning Object (as a learner/student) and decided to take the opportunity to reflect on what the experience was like from an end user perspective. Throughout the process, I considered what went well, what could have worked better and what I felt was missing. This exercise resulted in something of a <em>structural</em> epiphany as I realised that I had missed some vital steps in the conceptual model, this was further borne out when I started my wireframe drawings and found that there were things that simply did not add up. Below is my, step-by-step written account of my experience in the Learning Object, I have highlighted sections of particular significance. My next post will outline some of the decisions that took place from December 16th onward.
<hr />
<div>Note: this Learning Object has a longer duration than the one that I am building (about an hour in total). I took some screenshots for personal reference, but I cannot include them in this narrative as it is a proprietary system protected by copyright.</div>
<div></div>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Includes a title page</li>
	<li>Opens in a new window and features an audio narrative that matches written information on-screen</li>
	<li>Has a keyboard shortcut clearly defined for navigation through the learning object. The keyboard shortcut is ""c"" this is not the most comfortable key on the keyboard to use. For righthanded people the arrow keys are in a better position. I am interested in why they chose ""c"". I think that spacebar might offer a better experience for right-handed and left-handed people and also has an association with start and stop, due to its use in YouTube and other video streaming services as a start/stop video option.</li>
	<li>Has a menu which persists throughout the LO with settings options clearly visible</li>
	<li>Allows the option to replay each section or skip to the next</li>
	<li>Has integrated accessibility tools to adjust: colour scheme (background colour for the most part), audio on/off and subtitles. Also has a zoom and menu for accessing all settings that shows in each view at the top-right of the window.</li>
	<li>visual pointers are shown to guide the user in the first screens.</li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;"">Includes an initial tour of the interface. How to save - how to adjust the view, sound settings etc.</span></div></li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;"">After that there is a welcome video outlining the content of the LO and the learning outcomes.</span></div></li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;"">Topic menu is shown on one page with a brief description of each topic and the time that it will take to complete the topic.</span></div></li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;"">Certificate is included on the topics menu which is something that I have been considering for my LO.</span></div></li>
	<li>
<div>
<div>Within the learning topics or lessons - multiple choice questions are included for comment and then follows up with integrated feedback. Most of the questions state, ""what's your opinion..."". <span style=""color: #333399;"">This is helpful in terms of the soft side of considering accessibility issues.</span></div>
</div></li>
	<li>
<div>Once you have answered the questions the narrative voice of the LO either agrees or partially agrees with the answers which are given by the user. Providing definitions and points to remember along the way.</div></li>
	<li>
<div>Uses display of very basic pie charts to show performance in certain areas, this is not particularly effective.</div></li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;"">Important to show progress through the lesson.</span></div></li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;"">There is not a test for each section - they have a test at the end.</span></div></li>
	<li>
<div>In each section the pages have the same layout, but the content on the page is flexible.</div></li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;"">Help question mark button goes to an online help guide about the generic use of the LO. However I was hoping for more of a Glossary to support one of the questions that I am being asked. NOTE to self- ""I need a GLOSSARY"" (said in the voice of the Knights who say ni).</span></div></li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;"">When you get something wrong, you kind of what to un-do it and then get it right. I think that building in a <strong>replay function</strong> for each question section is essential.</span></div></li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;""><strong>Final test</strong> - is accessed from the main menu. This is not a timed test. Feedback is provided on a per-question basis.</span></div></li>
	<li>
<div><span style=""color: #333399;""><strong>It is important to give people the option to take the test more than once to allow them to improve their score.</strong></span></div></li>
	<li>
<div>Answers are shuffled the next time that you take the test.</div></li>
	<li>
<div>Scenario-based questions are shuffled, so one question is different from the first time.</div></li>

Notes: the usability.gov website is mentioned (<a title=""http://www.usability.gov"" href=""http://www.usability.gov"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.usability.gov</a>). I particularly like the quick reference tabs on the left of the site, which slide out on hover. Also the type enlargement tool on their site, it is easy to use and very effective. Their page, <a title=""http://www.usability.gov/site-tour.html"" href=""http://www.usability.gov/site-tour.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.usability.gov/site-tour.html</a> which explains the site is really fascinating, in terms of showing the decisions that they made and why. I have also watched their webinar about the revamp of the site, featured on the page above.
Some key questions, funnily enough I keep coming back to these too!

- Who is the audience and who are our users?

It felt like the right time to get some simple mock-ups ready in Adobe Fireworks; thus we became electric and moved away from paper, but only temporarily as this will speedup some of the low-fi paper prototypes that I plan later on. Fireworks seemed like the best choice as it is javascript-centric and I think that in all likelihood the final product would be coded in <a title=""Bootstrap main site"" href=""http://getbootstrap.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bootstrap JS</a> (but that would be up to my hypothetical developer).
This is going to be a very long journal entry as there were a lot of decisions involved in taking the jump to the new format. Bear with me.
So first on my list, although I did it second (as I 'think' <em>in colour</em>) was to create a flexible frame-based mock-up of a topic page where learning content would be delivered. The frame size is set to 805 X 604 as this is the size of the window typically specified by <a title=""Xerte webpage"" href=""https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/xerte/index.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Xerte</a>, the University of Nottingham's Learning Object creation tool. The specific Xerte example that I drew inspiration from can be found at the following link: <a title=""Xerte online toolkit example"" href=""http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/toolkits/play_8203"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/toolkits/play_8203</a>. You will see that my progression buttons at the bottom of the page bears some resemblance to theirs, as I felt that it was an elegant solution to the problem in both a browser window and on a mobile device. I would be sure to cite this in my final code! However, I do think that a bit of polishing is needed and possibly an alternative for testing purposes; I think that the ""2 / 4"" looks like a button too, which could lead to confusion, so that is something to fix.

<strong>Several key decisions have gone into the wireframes:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I decided to use icons in order to minimise the size of side tabs (rather than text alone). I did not take this decision lightly as icons can be problematic due to individual interpretation. I looked through a cross section of modern icon collections online and I felt that the icons shown above were modern and appropriate for the user group of the learning object. The <em>Index </em>and <em>Save</em> icons are directly from the collection, <em>Glossary/Help </em>button is my own unique icon taking some inspiration from the icon set. I found the icon set at, <a title=""http://ewebdesign.com/"" href=""http://ewebdesign.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://ewebdesign.com/</a> (<a title=""direct link to source"" href=""http://ewebdesign.com/web-outline-icons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">direct link to page</a>). The icon set is originally from <a title=""http://dryicons.com"" href=""http://dryicons.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://dryicons.com</a> and licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 unported license (<a title=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"" href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>*), so the source of these icons would need to be cited in the code and site attributions. However at this point in the design process they are really just placeholders pending the decision of the Graphic Designer on the eventual (hypothetical) design team. I did try out an alternative save button from the icon set, just to test. However it did not work as well as the conventional floppy disk icon as shown below.

	<li>The <em>cog</em> on the bottom left, as a button to access settings <em>feels</em> correct in terms of positioning and I think that it stands out as an interactive tool without adding too much distraction to the learning environment. This cog is my own Adobe Illustrator drawing based on a cog designed by <a title=""http://www.gentleface.com"" href=""http://www.gentleface.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.gentleface.com</a> under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 unported license (<a title=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"" href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/</a> - as this is student work I am definitely not getting any commercial gain from this). I found the cog at iconfinder.com (<a title=""iconfinder direct source link"" href=""https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/42195/cog_icon#size=48"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">direct link to page</a>). The positioning and style of the cog was a result of my earlier on-paper sketching, so I feel that, that process was particularly valuable.</li>
	<li>Revisiting the wireframe above it seems that the audio mute button might want to be bigger in order to be more symmetrical with the settings button. I liberated the audio from the ""settings"" area; I have yet to fully define how the settings area will look. I did this because if an end-user were accessing the Learning Object from a mobile device they would want the default to be mute and then they could choose to turn on the audio narrative if they had headphones plugged into their device. Based on this I felt that making the audio settings more present and clickable/tapable would benefit, both users on desktop computers in office environments where computer noise might not be preferable and those on mobile devices.</li>

*A closer inspection of the web site's terms showed that the icons cannot be transformed in any way and have to be used as-is. The colour is inverted but other than that there are no structural changes. This suggests that these icons will need to be replaced in the final version of the site.

As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, I started with colour prototypes. The colour scheme was loosely inspired by the University of Exeter's blue, as outlined in their <a title=""University of Exeter visual identity"" href=""http://www.exeter.ac.uk/designstudio/visualidentity/thelogo/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">visual identity guidelines</a> although the branding for university-x needs a bit more thought.

As part of the accessibility settings it is necessary for the user to be able to change the font in the interface. I tried a few experiments to see how this would look, as different fonts take up differing amounts of space on the page. It would also be necessary to provide a contextual preview of these settings as users altered them, so they could see how the fonts and other adjustments would manifest.
I chose the fonts very carefully as although it would be great to offer a font like <span style=""font-family: verdana,geneva;"">Verdana</span> as a legible sans-serif, particularly because it distinguishes letters which often get confused ""I"" and ""L"", there are some font licensing considerations to bear in mind. I liked the example provided by the WebAIM accessibility website (<a title=""http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/"" href=""http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/</a>) where they use the word ""<em>Illustration""</em> to show the legibility difference between Arial and Verdana: e.g. in <span style=""font-family: verdana,geneva;"">Verdana: Illustration </span>and <span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Arial: Illustration</span>. I have included this word in my examples below to help show differences between the fonts. With regard the licensing issue mentioned above, as the ethos of this learning object is open source and having checked font distribution licensing for Verdana, Arial and others and finding that they were not ideal, I sought open source alternatives. Examples and annotation is provided below. It is also important the the selected fonts provide language support for translation engine purposes.
Font 1, the default, is PT Sans (shown in all visual examples above) a family licensed by the ParaType Ltd foundry: <a title=""http://www.paratype.com/public/pt_openlicense_eng.asp"" href=""http://www.paratype.com/public/pt_openlicense_eng.asp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.paratype.com/public/pt_openlicense_eng.asp</a>

Comments: this font uses height to differentiate, <em>I </em>and <em>L. </em>It features more curves than some of the other fonts, and doesn't have a lot of white space, so although it is condensed it might be better for some dylexic readers as this will limit the ghosting effect.

<strong>Fonts that I decided against and size decision</strong>
I took a look at some Google fonts, but felt that they did not fit the licensing needs as well as the SIL OFL fonts. Here are some of the fonts that I reviewed: <a href=""https://www.google.com/fonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:PT+Sans|Roboto|Tenor+Sans"">https://www.google.com/fonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:PT+Sans|Roboto|Tenor+Sans</a>
I also looked at an open font called Gen (<a title=""https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/gen-light"" href=""https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/gen-light"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/gen-light</a>) however when I looked at the work <em>Illustration</em> there was no differentiation between <em>L </em>and <em>I</em>.
In terms of the default size, I decided on 12pt based on some of the guidance included in the Web Style Guide 3rd addition. Specifically the ""Type Sizes for Comfortable Reading"" section: <a title=""http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/8-typography/4a-type-size-legibility.html"" href=""http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/8-typography/4a-type-size-legibility.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/8-typography/4a-type-size-legibility.html</a>

<strong>Further inspiration</strong>
In terms of further development of the settings and help/glossary, I found the following blog posts from the Nielsen Norman Group (NNG) to be particularly helpful.
<ul>
	<li><em>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</em>: <a title=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/"" href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/</a>
What not to do!</li>
	<li><em>Pop-ups and Adaptive Help Get a Refresh</em>: <a title=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pop-up-adaptive-help/"" href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pop-up-adaptive-help/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pop-up-adaptive-help/</a>
The example of the Google Play and AdWords help tools could offer an elegant solution for the glossary/help pop-up. Settings may be too involved to be a pop-up, as previously a preview of how the settings adjust the content would be helpful.</li>
	<li>The case against flat design. There are some helpful tips in this blog post about hinting at interactivity:

<strong>Session description:</strong>
Does your app rely on OAuth to offer connection to other apps and services? Based on my research studying app-to-device relationships in Internet of Things systems (e.g. Fitbit, Jawbone UP, Nest, SmartThings, Glooko), I have uncovered some best practice recommendations when it comes to inspiring trust within your interface.

— Eve Turner-Lee (@eturnerlee) <a href=""https://twitter.com/eturnerlee/status/715119791661531136"">30 March 2016</a></blockquote>
I am helping to organise a conference later on this month as part of my work on the UCISA Digital Capabilities group. The event is called the Spotlight on Digital Capabilities (May 25/26) and just to let you know, if you find this post particularly riveting there are still spots to attend! You can learn about the event <a href=""http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/groups/dsdg/Events/2016/digcaps.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>, and book to attend at the UCISA site here: <a href=""http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/groups/dsdg/Events/2016/digcaps/booking.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/groups/dsdg/Events/2016/digcaps/booking.aspx</a>
You may also recall <a href=""https://blog.rise.global/category/event-tech-2/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">my guest post on the Rise blog</a> about the gamification of last year's UCISA conference (as well as my <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/06/03/attempting-to-live-blog-while-running-a-twitter-competition/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">frantic live blogging during the event</a>). Well I am more actively involved in designing the gamification of <em>Spotlight </em>this year, so there will be more on that soon too!
One of the things that I am most looking forward to, as part of the <em>Spotlight </em>conference is a live debate that will take on the question: <em>Do we still need IT training teams?</em> This session will take the format of a town-hall forum style debate and will have a panel who explore different views on the topic as well as leading audience discussion. Part of the inspiration for the debate came from my experience attending New Media Consortium conferences from 2010-12 in the US. I remember the sheer energy of the townhall meeting events and the brilliant live drawing visualisations of the discussion, supplied by Rachel Smith. So with this in mind we are working with Brighton artist, Eve Turner-Lee to consider the best ways of visualising our discussion!
Back in March, Eve, my colleague Tucker and I met up to test out the best ways of visualising drawing. Our criteria were that whichever solution we ended up with would need to capture the drawing live and provide a video feed to the projection system somehow so that attendees could watch on screen. A bonus would be if attendees could also watch live from their own smartphones, tablets or laptops.
Here are the results of our investigations. Although Eve put it much more succinctly in her comic strip embedded at the top of this post!
<h2><strong>Option 1: Eve drawing on paper with live video capture
</strong></h2>
[caption id=""attachment_603"" align=""alignnone"" width=""157""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/boardonly-14yj2yk.png"" rel=""attachment wp-att-603""><img class=""size-full wp-image-603"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/boardonly-14yj2yk.png"" alt=""Drawing with pens"" width=""157"" height=""196"" /></a> Trying out drawing with pens on a standing whiteboard[/caption]
&nbsp;
<strong>Proposed scenario:</strong> Eve would draw on paper while wearing an iPhone camera harness or a <a href=""https://gopro.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GoPro camera</a> to video-capture her work live on paper using <a href=""https://www.periscope.tv/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Periscope app</a> (some. Fiona simulated this <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01EUAH7UQ"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01EUAH7UQ</a>) by recording with the Periscope app on iPhone. A computer connected via adaptor to the conference projection system could display the action from Periscope. Audience members could choose to watch from their own devices for a closer view via the Periscope app.
Here is a short video excerpt of one of our live recordings through periscope.
<iframe src=""https://mediastream.brighton.ac.uk/player?autostart=y&amp;fullscreen=y&amp;width=320&amp;height=260&amp;videoId=3394&amp;quality=hi&amp;captions=n&amp;chapterId=83"" width=""330"" height=""270"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Pros</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>People can watch the drawing from their personal devices</li>
	<li>Eve could wear the phone on a chest mount and that could capture the drawing well</li>
	<li>Get lots of attention - broadcast and promote the conference</li>
	<li>Nice Twitter tie-in</li>
</ul>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Cons</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>Can’t turn off the microphone - everyone would have to turn off their devices.
<ul>
	<li>tried covering the microphone</li>
	<li>tried external mic on mute</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Only have portrait orientation</li>
	<li>The quality of the video is not great</li>
	<li>Hard to get a good filming angle at the right difference to show how the drawing will take shape.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Verdict:</strong> Do not use. Although we could turn the sound off from the projection system feed, that does not stop the mic in Periscope from picking up sound. This could result in a veritable cacophony if everyone in the room, decided to watch on Periscope via their mobile devices.
<h2><strong>Option 2: Eve drawing on iPad Pro</strong></h2>

<strong>Proposed scenario:</strong> Eve draws on the iPad Pro using an app like Tayasui Sketches (<a href=""http://tayasui.com/sketches/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://tayasui.com/sketches/</a>) the iPad is mirrored to Fiona's Mac laptop (using <a href=""http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Reflector 2</a>) which is then connected to the projection system via adaptor (VGA or HDMI). For the sharing to mobile devices, we tried a live Google Hangout broadcast which was simulcast to YouTube.
Something to note is that the Refector 2 the software which allows your laptop to broadcast the screen of an iDevice (or an android, via Chromecast technology) features the option to include an iPad visual frame in the video. We have decided to include this on the day, as it will put the origin of the drawing into context.
From the laptop we shared the screen via a Live broadcast Google Hangout and YouTube
* Video from the YouTube broadcast: <a href=""https://youtu.be/RC20gb08vDM"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://youtu.be/RC20gb08vDM</a>
Not only is the video great quality, but the settings in Google Hangouts were fantastic and we were able to turn any potential microphone sound off.
<strong>Verdict:</strong> Use this! Always make sure that
<strong>Setup:</strong>
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Connect Fiona’s laptop to the projection system</li>
	<li>Make sure that the laptop and the iPad Pro are on the same Wi-Fi network</li>
	<li>Mirror the iPad to Reflector 2 software on the laptop</li>
	<li>Start recording the iPad in Reflector 2 so that you have a backup</li>
	<li>Launch Google Hangout on air and tweet link to live YouTube channel and hangout</li>
	<li>Make sure that hangout is set to mute audio and video of attendees (cameraman settings)</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<strong>Video summary of the workflow:</strong>

<h2><strong>Option 3: Eve drawing on paper on the document visualiser/document camera</strong></h2>
<strong>Verdict:</strong> Do not use - Too old-school! Just paled in comparison to option 2!
<h1>Final verdict: iPad Pro &gt; Laptop running Reflector 2 &gt; to projection System &gt; whilst running google hangout broadcasting to youtube</h1>

Does your app rely on OAuth to offer connection to other apps and services? Based on my research studying app-to-device relationships in Internet of Things systems (e.g. Fitbit, Jawbone UP, Nest, SmartThings, Glooko), I have uncovered some best practice recommendations when it comes to inspiring trust within your interface.
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Trust definitions used in this video are from Pavlidis, Islam, Mouratidis, and Kearney (2014).</span>
This research is aligned with the SenSe research Cluster at the University of Brighton (secure and dependable software systems).
<strong>About SenSe</strong>
The SenSe cluster aims to develop novel and pragmatic ways to assure the dependability of software systems with particular emphasis on security, trust and risk. We focus on theories from model-based engineering and analysis-based assurance to develop methods, models, practices and tools that promote the provision of security and dependability in complex interconnected and heterogeneous systems and information infrastructures that underpin our economy and society.

<td>3</td>
<td><strong>Checkups for Setup/Workflow/Privacy
</strong>An essential part of onboarding. Also a method for supporting trust and helping users to invest time in learning the higher-level functions of an app, which promotes realisation of app benefits and long-term commitment to use of the app (Brignull, 2013).<strong>
</strong></td>
<td><strong>Periodic reminders about setup:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Can the setup be improved?</li>
	<li>What devices could be added safely?</li>
	<li>What benefits might be available as part of the system that the user may be unaware of?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Periodic review of workflow:
</strong>ask users to review the workflow in the system to add a level of human oversight. If the app is not accessed frequently then email and text message may be effective ways to prompt engagement. Think of it like entering a monthly gas meter reading. <strong>
</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Is an automated workflow still operating as intended?</li>
	<li>Is the function still needed?</li>
</ul>
A possible incentive could be that the workflow will stop/timeout if it is not reviewed a la IFTTT.<strong>
</strong>
<strong>Periodic review of p</strong><strong>rivacy:
</strong>privacy overview and audit tools within the app.
<ul>
	<li>What information is shared with third-party developers?</li>
	<li>For what purpose/s is it shared?</li>
</ul>
Non-legalese overview of changes to T&amp;Cs should be included in privacy checks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><strong>Role/function of the app
</strong>Applies to central app and third-party apps.</td>
<td>
This sounds really obvious, but a lot of primary IoT apps don't actually explain their purpose within the system.
What service does the app offer?
What need does the app fulfill?
What does the app do?
How important is the app to the operation of the system? E.g. is it the primary interface or management tool for the system?
What data does it need? - Make it clear what is used and why, in plain English.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><strong>Health/status of hub/sensor/device
</strong>At any point in time the user should be able to view a basic log of what is currently going on in the system.<strong>
</strong></td>
<td>
What is going on in the system right now?
Is recent system activity accessible?
Is it possible to access logs from other time periods?
Is it possible to see what communication channels are in operation?
What third-party apps are connected to the system, what are they doing?
What third-party devices are connected to the system, what are they doing?
This should be more like what you expect from your banking app when it comes to overseeing the operation of high-importance health, home/business automation IoT systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td><strong>OAUTH and API: secondary app data use</strong></td>
<td>
Respect users and prove that your app is more trustworthy by only calling data that you are actually using.
What data is needed into order to provide the desired third-party service?
How is the data used to provide the service?
<strong>Note:</strong> platform manufacturers/developers need to ensure that third-party apps aren't over-privileged in terms of the data they access and the calls they can make via APIs (See the work of  Fernandes, Jung and Prakesh, 2016). Developers need to state their intention when it comes to use of information that they call via the API. This doesn't stop those with malicious intent, but it helps users to distinguish between those who pay due diligence to privacy and those who are either malicious or sloppy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td> <strong>What is shared?
</strong></td>
<td>
Can data access be allowed/disallowed?
Once disallowed from the primary app, is this decision upheld?
<strong>Ideal world:</strong> provide granular options for allowing/disallowing access to data which is not necessary for the operation of the service offered by the app. Better yet, don't ask for the data at all if it isn't essential to operation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td><strong>Access control</strong></td>
<td>
Is two-step authentication an option for the web app and login from a new device?
Does the smartphone/tablet app offer biometric authentication?
Does the app offer the option of setting a passcode for auto screen lock?
Particularly if the app controls home appliances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td><strong>Dependency and operational relationship</strong></td>
<td>
As systems become more complicated it is crucial that the user is aided in building a mental picture of the basic configuration of the system. I keep thinking of Max when I think of this: <a href=""https://cycling74.com/products/max/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://cycling74.com/products/max/</a>
Is logging available?
What is going on in the system right now?
What is attached to this system (devices/sensors/users)?
Is the system visualised in any way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td><strong>Try before you buy</strong></td>
<td>
Wearables have the right idea on this one, allowing you to trial a wearable companion app using your smartphone's built-in sensors. What if you could try out the perks of the system before you buy the actual device?
Is a preview of how the app will operate with devices, provided as part of onboarding?
Can you try of some of the functionality of the system without buying a system-specific device?</td>

A shorter journal entry for today. I am going to provide a brief outline of what I have been working on, as I need to crack on with planning materials and more development work this week.
<!--more-->
<ul>
 	<li>I have completed an initial version of the Lean Business Model Canvas, as mentioned <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"">in my earlier post</a> referencing UX documentation and design artefacts. I obtained the template recommendation in Cao &amp; Bank's (n.d.) book on UX documentation (the template is available at this URL: <a href=""http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbase/resource-library/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lean-Business-Model-Canvas-template.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbase/resource-library/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lean-Business-Model-Canvas-template.pdf</a>).</li>
 	<li>I have asked my friend Jason to take a look at my code for the arrow button navigation, so I will work on some more tweaks to that tomorrow.</li>
 	<li>Due to extremely limited time this week as a result of some unanticipated work commitments, I haven't got as much development work in as I would like. So I have focused on a few fixes on this site as they were smaller thinks that I could achieve in the time that I had.
<ul>
 	<li>I removed a superfluous hyperlink in the footer.php - it was a <em>copy and paste</em> mistake.</li>
 	<li>I decided not to ""provide a choice of fonts"" (see <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/31/development-prototypes/"">last post</a>) as it felt like it might offer too many options.</li>
 	<li>I decided to install the <a href=""https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WP Accessibility Plugin </a>- I have worked with it before and found it to be one of the best plugins in this area. It offers user-facing tools and some javascript additions to fix common issues in WordPress. Even though I have an accessibility tagged theme, there are additional tweaks that can be completed such as removing title attributes in areas where they aren't needed and enforcing alt tags. It also allows you to add an active link highlight, which I am initially trying out with a contrast tested purple colour (essentially it puts a box around any active element).</li>
 	<li>I worked on a few customisations of the plugin:
<ul>
 	<li>I added it to a sidebar widget instead of the toolbar that is typically used with the plugin. This is mainly due to some issue with the display of the toolbar and also it made sense to present the accessibility options above the background colour options.</li>
 	<li>I customised the font-family and font-size of the text in the accessibility widget.</li>
 	<li>I enabled the high-contrast and font-size (large text) options as part of the WP Accessibility Plugin.</li>
 	<li>I customised aspects of the large text display so that it worked better with the theme, initially some text was too and some was too small. For example, H2 was a too small in comparison to the paragraph text and stylistically and readability-wise it wasn't great.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>I also changed the text-transform settings on the widgets header text as I noticed that these were all uppercase. This is not the best for Dyslexic readers according to Gov.uk's recent accessibility posters (<a href=""https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility/posters_en-UK"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility/posters_en-UK</a>). I find this series of posters to be very helpful cheat-sheets for accessible design.
<ul>
 	<li>Related findings:
<ul>
 	<li>Gov.uk Accessible Blog: <a href=""https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dos and don'ts on designing for accessibility</a></li>
 	<li>Gov.uk Government Digital Service: <a href=""https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/20/user-testing-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">User testing accessibility</a></li>
 	<li>Gov.uk Advisory: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Making your service accessible</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Also in my travels I found the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) - this was recommended both by the WP Accessibility Plugin authors in the documentation and on the Gov.uk page above on the ""making your service accessible"" page.</li>
 	<li>The report (although it will change as the site is being updated)<a href=""http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/</a>
WAVE highlighted some more bits that I need to work on and I do still need to look at the contrast of the text in comparison to the background in the different colour schemes. The ""making your service accessible"" page states that automatic tools like WAVE can only detect a proportion of issues (around 20%-30%: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction</a>). So I need to ensure that I don't regard these tests as exhaustive moving forward.</li>
</ul>
I feel that I have learned quite a bit about accessibility through my work on this journal site, as well as honing my existing skills. So I will take these ideas and techniques forward with me as I continue to work on my portfolio project.

 	<li>General characteristics for user groups</li>

 	<li>A paper prototype – the prototype may actually need to be made in a prototyping tool so that Theo and I can discuss it via email. So probably a change of plan on this one.</li>

<code>------09:35 - What's New for Education-----</code>
Three core pilers of Apple technology - Accessible; Relevant; Personal.
Talks about the introduction of iOS 9.3 - powerful addition to the education offering.
<ul>
	<li>Includes: Apple School Manager and the classroom app
<ul>
	<li>Enabled shared iPad for students</li>
	<li>Classroom app for iPad - like a teaching assistant and classroom control application</li>
	<li>Apple School Manager</li>
	<li>Managed Apple IDs (aka bulk Apple IDs at institutional level).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<code>---Marc Bernard - 09:45 - New collaboration features in iWork---</code>
Components of iWork:
<ul>
	<li>Pages</li>
	<li>Numbers</li>
	<li>Keynote</li>
</ul>
Lara (Havord) and Marc demonstrate the collaborative functions - scenario is that they went on a field trip to the Tower of London and they want to collaborate on the materials in order to create a school trip report and presentation.
[aside] The Wi-Fi at the venue is not working, I am fairly impressed that they are Bluetoothing directly to the AppleTV. That is thinking on your feet. [/aside]
You just need to get the link to the other person in order to start collaborating in iWork - this could be via iCloud email, iMessage, airdrop or <a href=""https://www.showbie.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Showbie app</a>.
Lara and Marc show how two people can simultaneously work one document. The live changes are shown in the original document real-time if the app is open.
The add people function is found under the more option [...] on the top-right hand side of the app. Audience Q: What is the limit for the number of collaborators? They will come back to that, but it sounds like they haven't tested the limit. Answer to the limit question - 100 people maximum!
Demonstrate the use of app multitasking in order to use Safari look up some information to enrich their presentation. They are now working Keynote to build a joint presentation for their field trip.
Marc then demonstrates how to use Apple maps to find some information about the Tower of London. In the top-right corner there is an (i) symbol which will provide options, such as adding directions to a map. However in the example, Marc uses Apple maps to load a satellite view. He uses the 3D flyover mode and then takes some screenshots in order to produce some more images for their joint presentation.
Marc now wants to add some media rich content to the presentation. They are now demonstrating the use of iMovie app to create a short video using photos taken during their hypothetical field trip to the Tower of London. Lara arranges the photos on the timeline taking advantage of the Ken Burns effect and then records a voiceover and exports the project.
They pop back into the collaborative Keynote project and then place the movie from the media browser.
<strong>Final function - Keynote live</strong>
Generates a link and it will publish the presentation to the Internet and then you can control the presentation from the iPad. In theory with stable Wi-Fi this could be used for wireless presentation from an iPad. Definitely worth a test in a classroom.
<code>----10.15 - iOS10 and 10.20 - Accessibility with iOS 10----</code>
Steve - works in teacher training and also in universities.
Asks us to think about how we might use the functionality in our own teaching contexts.
Steve is going to start by talking about Notes as the example app.
Does multitasking actually help? For the browser I would say yes.
<strong>Safari function revelation as a result of multitasking!!</strong> Drag a tab off the safari browser to the right-hand side and then get split screen! Perfect for comparisons between sources, e.g. you could use this for the Guardian vs. the Daily Mail.
OpenDyslexic keyboard can be added as an additional keyboard, I have also added the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/myscript-stylus-handwriting/id931394264?mt=8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">My Stylus app</a> as a supplemental keyboard to enable handwriting as a keyboard. This was a tip from Craig Wakefield! Here is how to add a supplemental keyboard: <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202178"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202178</a>
Also folks often miss the new drawing tools in the Notes app which can be used for classroom notes and for quick annotations.
<strong>Accessibility</strong>
Talks about how useful the zoom tool can be for teaching. SEE Settings &gt; General &gt; Zoom. A double-tap with three fingers will bring it up and a double-tap with three finger would dismiss it. The window can also be resized by pressing at the bottom of the zoom lens.
Magnifier can be used nicely as a visualiser. When it is turned on a triple-click on the home button will then turn on the camera with enhanced magnification. It does have a freeze option, which is helpful if you are using it as a teaching visualiser.
<strong>The BIGGY</strong>: SEE Settings &gt; Display Accommodations &gt; Colour filters &gt; turn on colour filters and then select the intensity and hue. This will CHANGE my life for reading and is helpful for both colour bling and dyslexic users. It is the colour overlay that we have all been looking for!
Speech has added functions for correcting pronunciations. This is helpful when you use speech for reading out loud. I use this function a lot for reading out PDFs of academic papers and there are some technical words, which are frequently mispronounced so this will be helpful for correcting that.
Demonstrates <strong>Switch Control</strong> - this is where the devices camera can be used in order to use the device. The camera looks for your head tilting the the left or right, this can be used to control on the on-screen functions.
<strong>Guided access</strong> can be used to focus attention, lock to a specific app and make parts of the screen inaccessible. See General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Guided Access. This will allow you to kiosk to a single app and then control which functions are available within the app.

<code>----10.50 - Deployment----</code>
Luke and Stewart - Systems Engineers - Introduce New Learning Environments
The message: ""Making it easier for schools to put devices in the hands of students.""
An audience member mentioned use of Meraki, so they will come back to that.
9.3 signifies a shift towards the addition of more educational functionality.
<ul>
	<li>Classroom app</li>
	<li>Shared iPad</li>
	<li>Apple School manager
<ul>
	<li>Managed IDs inside apple manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Shared iPad feature:</strong>
Gives you a personalised experience on a shared iPad. Login with an AppleID and then their personal information is synchronised back up to the cloud. [Audience point: provided they remember their passwords - will come back to this as it can be easier than AppleID].
Takeaway from today: taking control of a group of devices and waking them all up simultaneously. Control activity on the devices.
Apple School manager: allows for the creation of bulk AppleID on behalf of students. Can supply up to 100,000 IDs at one time.
Best things about shared iPad:
<ul>
	<li>Photo ID lets students find their iPad fast</li>
	<li>Log in with Managed Apple IDs</li>
	<li>Simplified login for younger students</li>
	<li>Data stored in the cloud and cached on device</li>
	<li> You decide the number of students for each iPad (e.g. if you allow 6 students, then the 7th student will bump off the oldest profile. The oldest profile will be backed up to the managed iCloud account).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Can use Classroom app to manage exams and lock down to only specific application and disallow multitasking. You can simultaneously lock all devices at a given point.</strong>
Classroom app key functions:
<ul>
	<li>Launch and lock apps</li>
	<li>See what your students see</li>
	<li>Create groups of students</li>
	<li>Share student work over AirPlay</li>
	<li>Reset forgotten passwords</li>
</ul>
As long as the device is enrolled in the MDM then it can be used with Classroom - it will depend on configuration planning.
You can put the devices into classes - e.g. if you only have one set of iPads for the school then you might find that putting the iPads into a single class.
Assign functionality:
Scenario - walk into the classroom and pick up an iPad and immediately sign-in. Must take the lest amount of time possible.
The assign feature throws up the name and face of the student who used the iPad last so that they can return to using that iPad that they already have their data on them. It is fine for the student to use a different iPad, but it will be more seamless for the student to return to the iPad that they had already used.
Create groups of students - so students can be assigned to separate tasks in the room on the devices.
Multiple instructors can have access to the classroom and can manage the students.
Using airplay in conjunction with the classroom app will allow you to share a student's work to the classroom display system.
The Classroom app is:
<ul>
	<li>Available for free in the App Store</li>
	<li>Configure and deploy with MDM</li>
</ul>
<strong>Apple School Manager</strong>
""Think of it as the hub for your deployment from an administrative perspective"". It sits alongside MDM.
<ul>
	<li>If it is admin (buying stuff, managing IDs) it is Apple School Manager</li>
	<li>If it is to do with device configuration then it is your MDM.</li>
</ul>
Important question: how do I get all of my roster information into Apple School Manager.
There is a function coming soon that will allow direct plugin to data in systems like capita.
At the moment this is facilitated by CSV import. You need to setup an SFTP connection as well. - More information needed on this.
Photo information is held by the MDMs, not by Apple School Manager.
If you are using a device enrolment programme you can bring all of the devices and apps purchased in the institution can be brought into Apple School Manager.
<strong>From now on if you want to buy Apps and Books in bulk you will use Apple School Manager.</strong>
<strong>iTunesU is going to become more integrated within Apple School Manager - this is going to become more like a VLE. With materials and grades displayed together and the ability to enrol students in classes.</strong>
<strong>More points about Apple School Manager:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Designed for education</li>
	<li>Created in bulk through Apple School manager</li>
	<li>Managed by schools and districts</li>
	<li>Supports multiple roles</li>
</ul>
Have flexibility in your AppleID naming conventions. So for example username could be used, e.g. in my case fjm15@myschool
<strong>Roles and </strong><b>privileges</b>
Content manager role: don't see anything to do with people or students, but you could buy books and apps.
Essentially there is a role for any level of access you might need.
<strong>New Management Features</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Show and hide apps (you can hide things like photos app and iMessage)</li>
	<li>Home screen layout (you can define folders and layout of apps).</li>
	<li>Lost mode (e.g. if found then return to...)</li>
	<li>Additional restrictions (notification settings can be restricted so that students aren't dinged by badges and pop-ups encouraging them to update).</li>
</ul>
<code>----Hands-on classroom demonstration----</code>
When you launch the classroom app then you are shown a list of classes so that you can pull up your student list/roster.
<strong>Individual iPad versus Shared</strong> <strong>iPad</strong>
<strong>This is where the Assign function comes</strong> <strong>in.</strong>
When you press Assign the classroom app tells you how many devices are available in the room. Then you can assign the iPads to groups of students and then you can see which stage all the students are at in the room (little app icons are shown next to student names on the photo roster). Everyone selects their own passcode at first login.
Demonstrates ""open app"" function so well all are taken into the teacher's selected app. Then you can specify that the app is locked after opening - the students cannot exit the app. Even if you put the iPad to sleep then you wake up the device you are still locked into the app. If you do a hard reset then you will be removed from the controlled environment. Unlock, means that the students are released from the app but not automatically taken out of the app.
Navigate options: iBooks, iTunesU and Safari
The teacher can use the share button on the top-right of safari to automatically share a web page with the class, so this could be used to pre-cue the content.
Also there is a mini view of all the iPad screens in the classroom app. While the teacher is reviewing the iPad screens then the blue bar (like AirPlay) is shown to indicate that the students' activities are under review. If you press on an individual student from the ""Screens"" area then you can quickly AirPlay a student's screen to the classroom display system.
Groups could be used for assigning activities, but also for allowing exam exceptions if the devices were used in a controlled situation, this could also be locked into a specific app or web page.
You can also enforce logout for students - so this triggers the synchronisation to iCloud process.
If you are using Volume Purchase Programme - it will only consume one licence even though there multiple users on the iPad.
Existing AppleIDs cannot be ingested into Apple School Manager.
<code>----11:50 - Teacher Resources----</code>
Links to these will be shared later - I'll add the links here when I have them.
Helpful series of Apple iBooks - new guides for using apps in education. These are available for iPads and for Macs.

<code>----12.00 - Discussion tables----</code>
Swift Playgrounds certainly isn't <a href=""http://www.appinventor.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Android app inventor</a> - it <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">is</span> a nice iPad app. For HE, in terms of language learning, you need something that is device agnostic and doesn't involve installing bulky SDKs (aka Xcode) for it to be scalable in a higher education setting I feel. So to summarise, I like Swift as a language and I like Swift Playgrounds as an individual activity, but something more like Code Academy in the web browser would be more useful for teaching at HE level.
<strong>Overall:</strong> an interesting day and I learned quite a bit. Perhaps a Swift specific #appswap crossover with staff code club is on the horizon!",Apple Events: What&#039;s New in Education &amp; Everyone Can Code,,publish,closed,open,,apple-events-whats-new-in-education-everyone-can-code,,,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,,0,http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/fjm15/?p=631,0,post,,0
739,1,13/10/2016 21:34,13/10/2016 21:34,"This journal entry continues on from the section, ""<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/07/hello-world-the-epitome-of-the-inaugural-blog-post/#first"">First thoughts related to this journal site</a>"" in my first post. In that section I outlined plans to test a number of WordPress themes that had been tagged with accessibility. This led me down a fascinating path of learning with one wrong turn along the way.<!--more-->
<h3>The testing process</h3>
In my last post I outlined a number of themes that looked like possible candidates, including the following:
<ol>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/afterlight/"">afterlight (Automattic, 2015)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/search/chuchadon/"">chuchadon (Keijonen, 2016a)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/e-nigma-2015/"">e-nigma (Lüken, 2015)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/kuorinka/"">kuorinka (Keijonen, 2016b)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/"">twentyfifteen (WordPress.org, 2016a)</a> (WordPress core theme)</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/"">twentysixteen (WordPress.org, 2016b)</a> (WordPress core theme)</li>
</ol>
As part of the testing plan I used a several tools, listed at the bottom of this post, to analyse the best themes. Please note, that some themes did not reach the full testing phase due to issues that I would term as <em>deal breakers</em>; the issues identified were troublesome enough where it was not worth continuing with those themes. I also entered into this testing process with an intention to attain a WCAG 2.0 Level AA (W3C, 2016a) accessibility rating for my journal site. This is largely because accessibility is a budding specialism of mine and I wanted an excuse to delve around in the innards of the newest WordPress themes!
<h4>Testing results and observations</h4>
<ol>
<ol>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/afterlight/"">afterlight</a>
I decided not to install this theme. Although 'afterlight' had the accessibility tag, I found on inspection of its specifications that it is based on having a background image throughout each area of its architecture (landing page, pages, posts - all had to have a single background image). Upon previewing this with my content, using the WordPress theme preview tool, I found that this negatively impacted readability. As the purpose of this blog is to engage in reflection, it seems important not to distract from that at the design level.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/search/chuchadon/"">chuchadon</a>
This theme has (or rather had) a lot of potential and is coded according to best practice (e.g. accessibility tagging) outlined in the WordPress Accessibility Handbook (WordPress.org, 2014).
<div>
I realised later on looking at in-code documentation that this theme is based on a starter theme, Underscores (or “_s”). A bare bones CSS starter theme (Underscores, 2016).
</div>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately after venturing as far as creating a child theme, I found issues in the some of the front-page template functionality. I also discovered that the links through to the theme documentation were broken and as a result I decided cease using the theme.</span></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/e-nigma-2015/"">e-nigma
</a>I do like the clean lines and simplicity of enigma, even in light of the negative points outlined in the slideshow below, it is certainly a worthy candidate. However, the dependence on the burger-style menu (the three lines) although often essential on mobile versions of a site, is less effective when viewed in a conventional web browser. I decided to seek out a theme that offered more versatility for delivery of the navigation menu/s.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/kuorinka/"">kuorinka
</a>Initially I really liked the simplicity of this theme design and it is very responsive, however in terms of accessibility it has some problems. Namely, it does not support reader view in Firefox 49 or Safari 10 and also was not good in terms of respecting the heading levels for the screen reader. I did not complete the other tests as these two issues were deal breakers.</li>
 	<li>
<div><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/"">twentyfifteen</a></div>
<div>
The ultimate in clean and simple. Although as a seasoned WordPress user the annual core template always <em>looks</em> like the annual core template, even with customisation. Twentyfifteen is quite book-like in its bi-fold layout and this doesn't strike the desired tone. As I tend to be quite verbose in my writing, I think that a theme with better except support is better. Having said that, the core templates can provide excellent bases for creation of child themes.
</div></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/"">twentysixteen
</a>A fresh approach to a traditional blog layout with some very nice built-in features. Highlights include the support of the <em>read more</em> tag for determining the length of post/entry excerpts shown on the front page. I also like the presentation of the author avatar, together with post tags on the left-hand side of each post. This theme has good customisation options and good widget support (the tools that you can place in the aside-style columns in the layout). A solid theme, not the most riveting to look at, but it ticks all of my accessibility boxes!
<h5 id=""contenders"">The final two contenders</h5>
I ran an IDI web accessibility check and used Firefox accessibility checker plugin (SEE <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/13/theme-testing/#tools"">tools section</a> for links) to enable keyboard control on the two top candidates: twentysixteen and chuchadon.
Twentysixteen had two flagged elements when I looked at the posts page specifically - one was that h1 header element was nested, so the order of headers was not ideal. Also there was a missing label element in the search field. These would both be very easy fixes.
<div>
<div>Chuchadon had the same flag on the header nesting for a posts page, so it is likely that this is an issue that would be picked up for a number of WordPress based blog template. To test this theory I tested my own blog, which is based on the Edublogs implementation of WordPress. Interestingly this was not an issue on my blog (e.g. post: <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/06/14/trust-in-iot-app-interfaces-redux/"">MacNeill, 2016</a>) or another Edublog that I tried. I took a look at the .entry-title tag in the edublog and it was at h2 level rather than h1. This struck me as an issue with both these themes. So I created a child theme of Chuchadon to try out a tweak on line 353 of the CSS stylesheet. The tweak worked perfectly, but alas this was also when I realised that there were some other things that didn't work for me in chuchadon (front-page configuration and the documentation links).</div>
</div>
<h5>The final verdict</h5>
I have selected twentysixteen as my theme and have created a child theme to allow more space for customisation.

<strong>Just to clarify...</strong>
You may be asking, what is all this talk of child themes. Well in essence a child theme is augmented version of it's original parent. Essentially a child theme allows you to commit edits to the visual presentation as well as the functions of a WordPress site without editing the original theme's code. This is a smart tactic for customising a theme, particularly the core annual themes, as because WordPress as a CMS has frequent updates, any accompanying parent theme updates can be safely run without affecting the code in the child theme too much. The use of a child theme will also allow me to replace the parts of the CSS and theme functions that were identified in the IDI accessibility report.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<h5>Techie stuff</h5>
The server was down this weekend so I used this as an excuse to implement some technical tools which will help further down the line. First of all as I mentioned in my last entry I installed MAMP on my development computer. MAMP, stands for Macintosh, Apache, MySQL, PHP (""MAMP"", 2016) and allows to setup a local copy of WordPress on your computer.
I find having access to a local installation to be helpful for two reasons:
<ul>
 	<li>I can work on my child theme tweaks without having access to the server and test them out in a controlled environment.</li>
 	<li>I can test out themes and plugins without muddying my installation. Sometimes everything about a plugin can look good and then you install it and there are things are about it that don't work or the coding isn't up to scratch. So again it is good to have a test environment for that.</li>
</ul>
I also setup a github repository for version control; to track my changes to the theme files. This is the first time that I have setup my own repository, so it was definitely a learning curve for me. However, I think that knowing how to do this will be essential for my forthcoming work on my web portfolio project. Here is my repository for this site: <a href=""https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal"">https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal</a> - it seemed like the ideal opportunity to practice using a version control tool. It has been really useful thus far!
<strong>Thinking long and hard about plugin installation is a good idea...</strong>
I was right to spend time deliberating about the types of plugin to install. The problem with plugins is that you often have to spend time tweaking them for every update and every theme. My carefully considered decision to install the footnotes plugin has already had to result in CSS tweaks&lt;fn&gt;Why not use a footnote to explain what I did! I changed .footnote_plugin_text to change the width of the area where the footnotes are shown and the font size. I also had to make the table border elements transparent in the .footnote_plugin_link, .footnote_plugin_index. Finally I needed to manually change the position of the superscript figures as I wasn't happy with the distance of the figure numbers from the text characters, for this I changed the .footnote_plugin_tooltip_text class&lt;/fn&gt; due to how the footnotes were shown in the twentysixteen theme.

740,1,21/10/2016 15:22,21/10/2016 15:22,"I will write a longer post about the investigatory work that I have completed for my portfolio very soon. However in the meantime, I wanted to quickly outline some bug fixes in my child theme. Full details can be found in my GitHub repository here: <a href=""https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal"">https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal</a><!--more-->
These changes were based on reports from the:
<ul>
 	<li>W3C Markup Validation Service (W3C, 2016)</li>
 	<li>IDI Web Accessibility Checker (AChecker, 2016)</li>
</ul>
<h3>&lt;label&gt;</h3>
I finally managed to fix the label tag issue (mentioned in the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/13/theme-testing/#contenders"">""contenders"" section</a> in my last post). It was missing the id, so once I added id = ""search"" into the php file and added &lt;label for =""search"" to the searchform.php file it was sorted. That took a bit of troubleshooting for sure.
<h3>role</h3>
The NU HTML checker flagged some role distinctions that are not required for certain elements in HTML. I could tell that these roles were not needed in my updated child theme, so I removed the tags. These needed to be altered in the following files: header.php, index.php, sidebar.php and footer.php
New versions of these files have all been added to both the child theme folder and my <a href=""https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal"">GitHub repository</a>.
<h3>footer</h3>
I got the footer displaying, not only my freshly minted WCAG 2.0 AA compliance badge&lt;fn&gt;I'll have to keep testing this periodically as things that you add to specific posts can prompt warning. It is a good way to ensure that I pay as much attention to the mark-up as I do to the written content of this journal.&lt;/fn&gt;, but also my design credentials. Doesn't sound like a big thing, but it took me a while to figure out how to adapt the nested php ""echoes"" from the parent theme for my own purposes.
More soon...I'll be working on wireframes this weekend.

742,1,23/10/2016 22:45,23/10/2016 22:45,"Over the past three weeks since the start of the module, I have been working away on the development of my portfolio site concept and gaining domain knowledge to support the development process. I have found myself in a situation where I have been torn between completing the UX procedures and design artefacts that I learned about and implemented during previous modules and starting to code. It is like standing at the edge of an exciting, and slightly daunting, precipice wondering whether to make the leap. The good news is, I am close.<!--more-->
I must also at this point, state that I aim to make a real and useful website. It will be short and sweet but it will, hypothetically at least, fulfill a real-world purpose. I also hope that it will be possible to use the site to support future research work that I plan to undertake.
<h3>Process: A minimalist approach influenced by LEAN UX</h3>
I have found that I cannot bypass the UX design artefacts and documentation entirely as they have become part of the fundamental fabric of my thought processes! So I have decided to complete a very stripped down version, to ensure that I have a solid architectural foundation for what I am about to build. This approach will be composed of the following elements.
<ol>
<ol>
 	<li>A concept document in a bare bones form aka this journal entry!</li>
 	<li>Task scenarios - <a title=""a long link to a Google document viewer"" href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nxisu8BaAGM3iaJ1r7oZv4b-XAM59ZMapdnNgK0rQzc/edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this document</a> is the first version.</li>
 	<li>Business Model Canvas&lt;fn&gt;
Business Model Canvas (<a href=""http://www.businessmodelcanvas.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.businessmodelcanvas.com</a>), licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported licenses (<a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a>).&lt;/fn&gt; - an artefact template that I found via Cao &amp; Bank's, <em>The Guide to UX Design Process &amp; Documentation</em> (n.d.). This will be in a forthcoming journal entry.</li>
 	<li>General characteristics for user groups - this will also be in a forthcoming journal entry. Due to time contraints and available information, it is not possible to build thorough characteristics lists for all potential users. I am however, fortunate to have a real stakeholder who can provide feedback on my work and it's hypothetical usefulness. (more on this later on in this entry).</li>
 	<li>[Tentative plan] create a UML&lt;fn&gt;Unified Modeling Language - more information at wikipedia: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language</a>&lt;/fn&gt; diagram to ensure that each page and section of the site includes the correct information and functions. I personally find UML diagrams to be very helpful for archictectural planning. It can be a fairly basic model for this project, but I do find that the process of making the models uncovers things that you haven't thought about! I may find that this isn't needed, but I won't know until I start making it.</li>
 	<li>A paper prototype - as I am working with a real stakeholder, I want to show him something quick and easy so that he can visualise the concept and ensure that my representation and approach to the domain is accurate. I think that a paper prototype is the best way to do that, in order to move to the coding phase as quickly as possible.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<h3>Concept</h3>
The wait is over! Here is the concept.
The project's working title is <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic.</em> It is a website structured around a central page, which leads the viewer through a fictional narrative of a patient's experience of anxiety while awaiting a medical operation or procedure. In the narrative the patient will be using an electronic wearable device to track their own vital signs and also for logging their anxiety levels - the influence of this countermeasure will be explored. The narrative is represented through a navigable timeline enriched with the use of graphical, written and statistical information. The underlying project, to use wearable devices to measure patient pre-operative anxiety is attributed to and courtesy of Dr. Theofanis Fotis (School of Health Sciences, University of Brighton), whom I am collaborating with at this time.</span>
<strong>Scope</strong>
The <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>deliver an approachable overview of a research project - the proposed research project is to design a user interface for a medical wearable device to measure anxiety;</li>
 	<li>explain the issues that can result from pre-operative stress in patients;</li>
 	<li>provide a point of entry for those with little or no knowledge of the subject as well as explain the potential benefits of the project to experienced medical professionals.</li>
</ul>
The <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will not:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>provide indepth medical information;</li>
 	<li>provide any fully formed solutions or recommendations for implementation of wearable devices in a medical setting;</li>
 	<li>provide advice or suggestions for the production of patient care plans. As a narrative scenario it is exploring a hypothetical scenario in which a wearable device is used.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Benefits</strong>
The <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will provide the following benefits:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>it will provide a valuable resource for explaining the research project to potential funders and future stakeholders;</li>
 	<li>it will help to raise awareness of the potential issues related to patient pre-operative anxiety;</li>
 	<li>it will highlight potential ways that increased knowledge of a patient's vital signs and self-reported anxiety could improve patient care;</li>
 	<li>it will provide an accompanying contextual information for the proposed future interface design project;</li>
 	<li>it will be a publicity tool, that can be used to explain the project within the academic and medical online communities.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Goals</strong>
The following goals are related to the successful creation of the <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic:</em></span>
<ul>
 	<li>provide a valuable portfolio piece, not only in terms of web development, but also as a tool for the research team and collaborators;</li>
 	<li>contribute to the approval and ethics approval of this as a concept for F.MacNeill's final graduating project;</li>
 	<li>stimulate dialogue around the issues and ideas raised by the <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic;</em></span></li>
 	<li>encourage potential funders and stakeholders to invest in the project.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Objectives</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Create an accurate portrayal of a possible patient care scenario.</li>
 	<li>Provide information highlighting the benefits of the proposed project.</li>
 	<li>Pose the project concept as an open question in order to gauge feedback and interest from the medical community and potential funders and/or stakeholders.</li>
 	<li>The user audiences for this are diverse but have one thing in common, they have very limited time to engage with a website of this kind. This website should take no longer than 10-15mins to navigate, the equivalent of a typical coffee/tea break.</li>
 	<li>To be shared via social media between interested parties.</li>
 	<li>To be adaptive and easily viewed and navigated on mobile devices.</li>
 	<li>To be accessible to those on older web browsers (as far as possible).</li>
 	<li>To be accessible to users with disabilities, allowing for personal customisation (as far as possible).</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Research Team</strong>
Right now this is just me, however Dr. Fotis has agreed to review the materials and my hope is that if the site meets his approval then we will be able to use it to promote the real project. In the first instance it is a hypothetical project site, but that doesn't mean that you cannot aim high as I have outlined in the objectives above.
<strong>Audience</strong>
More detail on this in a future entry.
The user groups are: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">funding review panel members, academic staff at multiple Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), medical professionals.</span>
<strong>Stakeholders</strong>
Intially Dr. Fotis is the main stakeholder, however I would take this site forward as evidence to support my final project proposal. In that sense academic staff in the School of Computing are also future stakeholders.
<h3>Research of the domain and existing websites</h3>
I have been using my <a href=""https://trello.com/b/4a20fYpf/web-development-portfolio-project"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Trello project board</a> as a place to collect links and resources. On the one hand I have been looking at the specs for potential wearable devices, it is out of scope to suggest an actual solution but I would like to supply some possibilities in terms of device form so that the project is tangible. I have also been reviewing materials that Dr. Fotis provided to help gain domain knowledge of a patient's pre-operative experience. I have listed these sources in my reference list below.
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ideassketch.jpg""><img class=""size-medium"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ideassketch.jpg"" alt=""Image of a sketch book page, including pencil drawing for the patient journey"" width=""100%"" /></a> Sketch of patient journey ideas
<strong>Existing websites</strong>
As a general observation medical websites tend to be firmly on the utilitarian end of the scale. This is understandable as information is usually important and needs to be delivered quickly. So it will be important to strike a balance between something eye-catching, which is also substantive.
Here is are few examples that I came across and wrote notes about (transferred from my trello board).
<code>-----------------Notes/Observations---------------</code>
This collection of timeline based websites and infographics is really helpful: <a href=""http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/timeline-in-web-design/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/timeline-in-web-design/</a>
Some of the examples are a bit old and don't work as well in contemporary browsers. This is something to consider.
Most of these sites are in a long-form vertical format. This is great and modern, but considering the audio for this site, this obscures some key aspects of the journey. Viewers will be time-pressured and need to see the journey/timeline elements as succinctly as possible. The following sites are closest to what I want to design:
<a href=""http://rodania.com/about"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://rodania.com/about</a>
This example is not very responsive, so that would be something to consider.
<a href=""http://minimalmonkey.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://minimalmonkey.com/</a>
This blog is quite nice but the scrolling right function would need to be made much more obvious.
<hr />
Vertical timeline examples:
I like the intro page segment on this one: <a href=""http://www.akita.co.uk/computing-history/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.akita.co.uk/computing-history/</a>
It isn't keyboard navigable though which is not great in terms of my accessibility goals.
This one is keyboard navigable and it aesthetically simple and user-friendly:<a href=""https://uk.protectyourbubble.com/iphone-timeline/#iphone-2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://uk.protectyourbubble.com/iphone-timeline/#iphone-2</a>
I quite like the simplicity of this one, it is text heavy, but it gets the message across quickly: <a href=""https://mixpanel.com/about/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://mixpanel.com/about/</a>
I like the use of months on the timeline on this portfolio site, although accessibility and control might be an issue here: <a href=""http://www.czk.fr/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.czk.fr/</a>
<hr />
A collection of horizontal scrolling sites: <a href=""https://webdesignledger.com/40-of-the-best-horizontal-scrolling-websites/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://webdesignledger.com/40-of-the-best-horizontal-scrolling-websites/</a>
<blockquote>Many of these are quite old or have changed format since the post was written. <strong>I found myself considering a horizontal layout due to the need to display data and the need for it to be readable, however horizontal layouts pose some real accessibility and navigation issues.</strong></blockquote>
<hr />
Recently updated list of infographics, including many interactive examples: <a href=""http://www.siegemedia.com/creation/best-infographics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.siegemedia.com/creation/best-infographics</a>
An oldie, but a goodie ""The Evolution of the Web"" as an example of a horizontal layout: <a href=""http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/#/evolution/day"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/#/evolution/day</a>
...and some justification for my concept!
13 Reasons Why Your Brain Craves Infographics: <a href=""http://neomam.com/interactive/13reasons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://neomam.com/interactive/13reasons/</a>
<hr />
This site uses the <a href=""https://timeline.knightlab.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Knightlab's Timeline JS tool</a>, which I have used many times, mostly in WordPress sites. This is a nice medical example, but I want something a bit more contemporary: <a href=""http://www.centenary.mrc.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.centenary.mrc.ac.uk/</a>
<blockquote>This site has the kind of section feel that I am looking for, although I still wonder how I can visualise anxiety in a vertical layout versus horizontal: <a href=""http://www.kocha.com.au/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.kocha.com.au/</a>
This site has nice comment mark-up and makes clear use of the &lt;section&gt; element.</blockquote>

<h3>Journal development</h3>
A quick run down of learning journal development activities. A full rundown can be found on my github development page, I have added a handy link to to this in the ""social menu"" on the right-hand footer of this journal site (circular icon with octo-cat logo).
<strong>Created an iframe embed in a widget for my trello board</strong> so that I can display it in the sidebar. In order to create this I referred to: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/danlec/hmQJP/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://jsfiddle.net/danlec/hmQJP/</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe</a>
Tomorrow I am attending a <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/WordUp-Brighton/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WordPress Meet-up at Barclay's Eagle Lab</a> in Brighton and as part of the event they will offer user testing. I thought why not add some functionality that I have always wanted to include AND get some tips. <strong>I have added the option for visitors to this site to change the colour of the background (behind the text) for accessibility reasons.</strong> I did this as by creating alternate child-theme style sheet and by installing the WP User Stylesheet Switcher plugin: <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-stylesheet-switcher/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-stylesheet-switcher/</a>.
This idea is inspired by software like of Adobe Acrobat Pro and GoodReader App (for iPad) which allow you to customise background colours. I referenced <a href=""http://irlen.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://irlen.com</a> for colour-palette inspiration. Visual stress when reading and/or perception of colour contrast are reasons why a user might wish to alter background colours.
<ul>
 	<li>hexidecimal colours used for initial function:
<ul>
 	<li>blue 1: #dfeced</li>
 	<li>blue 2: #9ab8fc</li>
 	<li>green 1: #a6f8e3</li>

I'll write about any resulting feedback and actions on this site later.
<strong>I added Google Analytics code to my version of the header.php file</strong>, this was not added to GitHub as it is specific to my version of the child theme. I decided against a plugin as I looked at a couple of options, but I didn't feel that having access to a Google Analytics data on the dashboard of WordPress was that important as compared to the account authorisation that plugins require to run (e.g. plugin that I looked at: <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-dashboard-for-wp/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-dashboard-for-wp/</a>). I like to keep an eye on web traffic for security and publicity reasons.
<h3>Coding practice</h3>
I have a Lynda.com course to wrap-up and I will post the details here when I finish. In the meantime, collectively I have now completed 200 exercises in Code Academy! I didn't do them all since the start of this module, but here is a screenshot of my badge!

745,1,26/10/2016 15:40,26/10/2016 15:40,"On Monday 24th of October, I attended a WordPress meet-up or rather ""Word-up"" event at the Barclay's Eagle Lab building in Brighton. The event was in two parts, the first part was a talk by prolific blogger, Livia Farkas and the second part was a user testing presentation/discussion.<!--more--> It was good to hear about the different plugins that Farkas uses in order to best serve her audience of subscribers many of whom are Hungarian. This presents interesting translation challenges from WordPress core's english, but also presents unique opportunities. She has managed to monetise her site through production of PDFs guides, print materials and short online courses related to women's lifestyle interests. A large part of her success seems to be derived from her carefully maintained email list and this is one of the potential benefits of using a CMS like WordPress. The vast range of plugins allow for expansion and can provide very powerful tools for driving traffic to your web content. With a site coded from the ground-up it is harder to integrate these elements and you may end up having to pay for several external services in order to manage these functions.
With WordPress the content is married-up to a multitude of plugins, allowing for self-service functionality. Although the downside, as I have hinted at in earlier posts is that plugins can become deprecated when they are no longer actively maintained by developers. So you always need to choose wisely AND be ready to jump ship and use an alternative plugin, which may impact the breadth of functionality.
<h2>User testing and accessibility discussion</h2>
The second part of the evening featured a short presentation on user testing. This was followed by a discussion/critique of websites by the people in the room. The first site that we looked at was for copyrighting agency. It was a very well-considered site, although there was a bit too much white space and this raised the issue of accessibility.
This provided an ideal opportunity for me to show this site and discuss some of the issues that the recent trend towards sparse black or grey-on-white design can present in terms of readability, navigation and contrast perception for disabled end-users. I showed this site's background colour switcher, as well as a code experiment from a couple of years ago showing what it is like for me to read black text on a white background (<a href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/</a>). I also showed the WordPress accessibility plugin (<a href=""https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/</a>), which I have installed on my work blog (see toolbar on the left: <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/</a>). Many folks had not heard of the plugin, so I felt like I was doing my bit to help promote awareness in this area. Overall the discussion was really interesting and I may consider talking at next year's WordCamp Brighton on the topic of accessibility. Alas there was not enough time in the end to run any user testing on my site, but the feedback was helpful nonetheless.

<h2>Portfolio development</h2>
One thing I have learned from working in IT for 7+ years is that it is best not to say what you will build until you know what you can build. Sometimes this is knowing the right people who can build it for you, sometimes this is knowing the right tools to use in order to build. With this in-mind I decided to use a long weekend off work to create some coding prototypes to check if what I was envisioning in my mind is actually possible. This is completely opposite of what I would do with UX where I design the interface first without getting too attached to a specific technology. This is okay, but there is value in understanding what can be achieved, especially as I am doing it all myself!
<h3>Prototype 1</h3>
My first prototype was a simple site based on the html5 &lt;section&gt; element&lt;fn&gt;Learned about this from pp. 18-19 and p.54 of the Introducing HTML 5 book (Lawson &amp; Sharp, 2012).&lt;/fn&gt;. My thought was that in a later iteration it would resemble something like this site: <a href=""http://www.akita.co.uk/computing-history/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.akita.co.uk/computing-history/</a> where container &lt;div&gt;s are added to the sections in order to align written and image-based content. I started by using header level ID tags as anchors for navigation through the content and then used the ""tabindex"" to determine navigation with the tab key. This prototype was fine, but I felt immediately frustrated by the jerkiness of the navigation; this would certainly take away from the experience of reading the content.
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8CQzRYzoM5s?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
<h3>Prototype 2</h3>
I asked Marcus for some advice about how best to implement a script to support smooth navigation. I had already done quite a bit of Google searching for a solution to this, but everything that I found involved jQuery &lt;fn&gt;For example this post on StackOverflow: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6677035/jquery-scroll-to-element/6677069#6677069"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6677035/jquery-scroll-to-element/6677069#6677069</a>&lt;/fn&gt;. There is nothing inherently wrong with jQuery, but I would prefer not to use any libraries for my site as it may impact loading time and time is crucial (as I said what I am creating is a <em>coffee break</em> website). Also I want to make sure that the code as kept as clean as possible, so that I can see how it works in Internet Explorer 9. This is because unfortunately for me, the bulk of my end-users, use that web browser (an emoticon is unprofessional, but a frown-y face here would articulate my feelings). Marcus suggested that I include the search term ""vanilla"" and this did the trick. Helping me to find an excellent piece of script that I could adapt by P. Gryzybek (see his blog post about it here: <a href=""https://pawelgrzybek.com/page-scroll-in-vanilla-javascript/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://pawelgrzybek.com/page-scroll-in-vanilla-javascript/</a> and the codepen.io source: <a href=""http://codepen.io/pawelgrzybek/pen/QEQoZL"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://codepen.io/pawelgrzybek/pen/QEQoZL</a>).
I have to admit that I did feel a bit guilty for adapting someone else's script, because I would like to have enough knowledge to create one from scratch on my own. However, at the moment my knowledge of the Javascript syntax is lacking a bit; essentially I know what I would like to do but I lack the right grammar to do it! So adapting other people's scripts, which I then cite in the comments is a good way to for me to learn.
In prototype 2, shown below, buttons are used to trigger the smooth scrolling. The smooth scrolling function itself is based on moving between sections as parts of an array (Crockford, 2008, p.58). This is a clean way of doing it as there is a clear chronology and index in the array and the scrolling movement reflects that. However, the array also meant that I needed to rethink my structure and consider naming properties carefully. For example, in the original script the parts of the array were called ""sections"" I knew immediately that I had to change that as I planned to use HTML5 sections, so having ""sections"" in the javascript would become confusing for anyone who needed to review my code later on. Therefore I changed that aspect to be ""parts"" in the .js file. Also I decided to introduce a new series of buttons with the purpose of moving from section to section of the site. These ""Next"" buttons use the same javascript ""scrollIt"" function but are independent from the section navigation buttons that float at the top-left, this will allow me to style them separately in the CSS later on. The arrays were both useful and frustrating as there are 12 ""Next"" buttons, whereas there are 13 sections (0-12) in the sections/parts array. This means that the ""Next"" buttons need to be staggered, so the ""Next"" button indexed at ""0"" points to ""1"", and ""1"" points to ""2"" and so on and so forth. This is a downside of reusing the ScrollIt function's array but better than adding another layer of script to run through.
The other thing that I spent way too much time on is trying to add keyboard-based navigation to prototype 2. I tried a few approaches including a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/switch_command_JavaScript"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>Switch</em></a> (this was most effective) picking up the values of the up (=38) and down (=40) keyCode values. I also tried to construct <em>if </em> and <em><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">do...while</a> </em>statements in javascript. However, try as I might I could not get the repeated use of the down key to keep going down the list, I could only get it going down to the second position and then it got stuck. I will need to seek advice on this and come back to it.
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRcH_KIdhmE?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
Having said all this, I am pretty happy with prototype 2 as a starting point and I feel that it can provide the structure needed for the next steps. So NOW I am ready to do more on wireframing and possibly physical prototyping.
As a start for the creation of these prototypes I used the <a href=""https://html5boilerplate.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> that is available on GitHub. It seemed like a good way of familiarising myself with all the parts that would be needed for a fully fledged HTML5 application. There are many template parts that I will likely discard, but it was certainly helpful to start this way and it provided a logical filing structure.
My new GitHub repository specifically for the portfolio project can be found here: <a href=""https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/portfolioproj"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/portfolioproj</a>
I also added a Normalize.css file based on this template from GitHub: <a href=""https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/5.0.0/normalize.css"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/5.0.0/normalize.css</a>
Based on Marcus's session this week, it is a good idea to include a normalize.css file as it standardises the browsers' built-in interpretation of styles.
<h3>Journal developments</h3>
I asked Marcus for some advice on the background colour changing widget (aka stylesheet switcher) and he felt that loading images for the colour-change buttons added to the processing load. I tried a few things in the MAMP version of this journal on my development computer, including changing the images to 1 pixel and then also trying to create <em>buttons</em> that could just be a colour and not a jpeg or png image file. None of these things worked well and I came to the conclusion that as I am working with a plugin and some of these tweaks broke the plugin, I just need to handle the plugin's limitations. As I don't have enough time to build my own plugin, I decided to made the images small and simple at 20px x 20px and then altered the stylesheet to make the layout more uniform so that they fit into the sidebar widget better and are shown in a row at most browser window sizes (the widget disappears at phone screen size, this is intentional in the Twentysixteen parent theme, to avoid clutter).
In addition, I added a piece of loading script at the top of each colour-option CSS file as I need each one to load the child theme's CSS, so that I don't need to make changes to all of the CSS files, only the main child theme version. I mapped the stylesheet switcher plugin's php to look in the ""css"" folder, but I also found that the main child style.css file needed to live in the root folder in order to operate properly (thank you Google Chrome console for highlighting this issue!).
A further development for the stylesheet switcher will be to look at the default hyperlink colours in relation to each background. This includes their active, inactive and visited states as the contrast in relation to the background colour needs to be readable for each colour.
Additional considerations:
<ul>
 	<li>do I want to provide a choice of fonts and if so, would I provide that function via a different plugin?</li>
 	<li>I should look at installing the <a href=""https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">accessibility plugin</a> and investigating the best settings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development log</h3>
It struck me that I am adding a lot of short notes and written updates to GitHub. I felt like it would be good to maintain a digest of these changes and thoughts in this journal, alongside my longer form writing. Therefore I did a bit of searching and found information about the atom feeds for ""commit"" changes (here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7353538/setting-up-an-github-commit-rss-feed"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7353538/setting-up-an-github-commit-rss-feed</a>). In order to display this feed, I needed an aggregator. I selected the CyberSyn plugin as it has been updated recently and offers excellent functionality (<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/cybersyn/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/cybersyn/</a>). However, as the GitHub commit posts are a bit code-like and lacking correct grammar, I don't want them on the front page of this journal but <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/category/dev-log/"">in their own category</a>. So I set the CyberSyn plugin to set all feed posts as a new ""development log"" category and used the Ultimate Category Excluder (<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-category-excluder/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-category-excluder/</a>) plugin to omit that category from the front page posts feed. I'm pretty happy with that!

1017,1,17/05/2020 20:23,17/05/2020 20:23,"Dr. Theo Fotis and I met on the 11th of January to take a last look at the site prior to my assessment. This meeting was mainly for fact-checking the information that I had written, but Theo also had some thoughts on ways to add clarity to the different sections. I have outlined areas in bold below, where discussions during our meeting became actions related to the site.
<!--more-->
In the Flickity carousel/timeline for the patient timeline Theo suggested that I have a two-part scenario as the assumption that the operation would be cancelled was slightly too harsh. However, it was still collectively deemed important to include the cancellation aspect as it would have an impact on patient stress (Ebirim &amp; Tobin, 2011). This means that <strong>I will need more space in the carousel/timeline</strong> cells to accommodate this change.
The ""Why Perioperative Care?"" section was also flagged as there wasn't enough about why perioperative anxiety is imporant and how a device would make an impact. Theo suggested that <strong>I add some data to support this section</strong> and sent along some reading suggestions.
Also in certain areas I was a little bit too anxiety-specific. Theo recommended that I somehow include that there is an interest in knowing more about a patients's overall health, from a nursing perspective as well.

<strong>Sharing what I have learned thus far from building my child theme</strong>
Mark Joste from the DMP PG programme invited me to join his project site <a href=""https://community.brighton.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">community.brighton.ac.uk</a>&lt;fn&gt;University of Brighton's Digital Award winning project&lt;/fn&gt; as part of an Accessibility special interest group. <em>Community</em> is based on WordPress, it felt like a good opportunity to share what I learned about the WP Accessibility plugin and the best settings for it's configuration. Mark is testing it out prior to deployment.
<strong>Have a project meeting on Wednesday
</strong>I have arranged a meeting with Dr. Fotis who has been away on a research trip. I plan to show him the designs and prototypes thus far and to iron out exactly what will need to go into the patient journey. I also need to find out more about the target audiences for the infographic/site as I don't know enough to come up with a basic set of characteristics (beyond what I have outlined already in the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nxisu8BaAGM3iaJ1r7oZv4b-XAM59ZMapdnNgK0rQzc/edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">task scenarios</a> and <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">concept</a>). I am also working on a higher fidelity prototype in Photoshop prior to meeting him. If time allows I may well make the prototype slightly more interactive in <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/experience-design.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adobe Experience Design</a> or <a href=""https://www.invisionapp.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">InVision</a> prior to our meeting. All of this feels like jumping ahead a bit, but this is necessary due to the structure of the project. As a general rule I learn by doing, so I have to set myself goals as I go along. You'll notice that I have dispensed with the paper prototype idea from the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>concept </em>journal entry</a>; I need to get further ahead than that so that I can actually 'build' a web-based project.
<strong>Wireframing</strong>
I did look at some wireframing tools, such as <a href=""https://balsamiq.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Balsamiq</a>, <a href=""https://wireframe.cc/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wireframe.cc</a>, <a href=""https://www.axure.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Axure</a>&lt;fn&gt;This one is definitely worth a more in-depth look over winter break in preparation for my final project.&lt;/fn&gt; and <a href=""https://www.mockflow.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MockFlow</a>. Once again though I found myself returning to my <a href=""https://rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_dotPad.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Rhodia dotpad</a>&lt;fn&gt;&lt;/fn&gt; and Adobe Photoshop for the wireframe and CSS grid planning. It just feels unencumbered and organised both visually and to an extent mathematically. <a href=""https://www.lucidchart.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Lucidchart</a> is certainly my tool of choice when it comes to UML diagrams, site maps, flow charts and task lists. Again, if I do decide to create a UML diagram&lt;fn&gt;Another to-do that I set for myself in the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">concept post.</a>&lt;/fn&gt;, I can only do so once I have a better idea of what information to include in the patient journey.
<strong>Coding
</strong>I have been trying out <a href=""https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WebStorm</a> alongside my old faithful <a href=""http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">TextWrangler</a> over the last few weeks as a complete solution for html, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I have to say I have been completely won over, especially since I hooked it up to my github repositories. It is actually a joy to use and alerts me to typing errors and possible syntax issues. I am delighted that it is available for free with a student email address.
<strong>Meetup
</strong>I attended the <a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Gamification-Meetup/events/234090387/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Brighton Gamification Meetup group on Wednesday</a> and was really inspired by some of the interface ideas that were discussed. Certainly worth bearing in mind in future, particularly The Manager's Path presented by<strong> </strong>Vasilis Gkogkidis (from Gamification+),<strong> </strong>which looks like a fantastic foray into self-tracking and self-betterment. I'll keep tabs on that as I consider the wearable app that I am looking to scope/design for my final degree project.
<strong>Development path this week
</strong>It seemed like the ideal time to move on from the ""firstedit1"" version of my prototype to a new branch, entitled ""portfolioprojv2"". I decided to use this new prototype as an excuse to update my CSS knowledge. Furthermore, after discussion with Marcus on Friday and testing on a PC this week, it seems that trying to make the site work in Internet Explorer is a no-go. I am finding that even with vanilla javascript, many simple features/functions that I want to add do not function at all in Internet Explorer 9. So what I will need to do is work on a more IE friendly version of the infographic in the future, but in terms of the assignment I need to focus on what will work in the majority of modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Edge). I will talk to Dr. Fotis about this as well, as undoubtedly some of these lovely British Medical Journal infographics don't work well in IE either: <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/infographics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.bmj.com/infographics</a> (thus my logical conclusion is that doctors might not view media-rich content at work in IE).

</strong>I really think that the scrolling function, as discussed in previous posts is good. However, it was clear that the function needed to be refined. Alas, as outlined above the function doesn't work at all in Internet Explorer 9. I also felt that if I were navigating this site, I may run out of time at some point in the patient story and want to skip to another area of the site, so some sort of navigation always needs to be available. So I started to think about what might be possible. I drew some inspiration from the fix top-bar in the Gamification+ site (not shown in the mobile view of the site): <a href=""https://gamificationplus.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gamificationplus.uk/</a>
I started with a fixed position navigation that travelled down the page as you scrolled. This was based on month of the story. However, conceptually I started to have difficulty with dates and months, as it may feel too constricted and also unrealistic (or worse still idealistic) for the audience. I decided that it would be better to structure the timeline aspect around activities that take place in-time; as due to a collection of possibly delaying factors who knows <em>when</em> our fictional patient's operation will actually take place. The positioning also ran counter to established navigation design patterns and would likely confuse users.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1072""]<img style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/01navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 1"" width=""1072"" height=""612"" /> Nav test 1[/caption]
While I was still thinking about months. I also tried placing the months at the top of the page. You will notice that I added mock-up navigation for the future pages on the top-right as well. Although I have shifted my thinking on the items in the navigation - <strong>About</strong> is the same as the <strong>Patient</strong>; the patient is a fictional device to explain the project. <strong>About</strong> should actually be <strong>Team</strong> as we need to introduce the more about the team and the goals for the project. <strong>Devices</strong> can stay as-is as this will be used to describe potential device types and physiological measurements/sensors per device.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1072""]<img class=""size-medium"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/02navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 2"" width=""1072"" height=""621"" /> Nav test 2[/caption]
I kept the <strong>next</strong> buttons with the top navigation, as you can see from the screenshot below. However, after thinking on it, it really seemed like the <strong>next</strong> buttons were the most useful. Especially as they could offer more scope for styling later on and they allowed the user to progress through the timeline or steps of the patient story in a sequential way. Also in IE, if these buttons are hidden because the function is unavailable then the page will still have logical navigation based on either scrolling or using the arrow keys.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1070""]<img style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/03navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 2.5"" width=""1070"" height=""618"" /> Nav test 2.5[/caption]
In the end I liked the <strong>next</strong> buttons as shown below (at 100% width) and then some kind of floating page navigation on the top-right. I shall have to look at some design patterns and have a think about the best way of doing that.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""911""]<img style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 3"" width=""911"" height=""540"" /> Nav test 3[/caption]
Then after the first <strong>Next </strong>button is clicked here is how the next section of the prototype looks (see Nav test 3.5 below). There is a nice amount of area for information.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""913""]<img class=""size-medium"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04_5navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 3.5"" width=""913"" height=""607"" /> Nav test 3.5[/caption]
The next step is to create a CSS grid system to ensure that alignment is accurate (as you can see above the text is not placed correctly). I found <a href=""http://j4n.co/blog/Creating-your-own-css-grid-system"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this post about grid setup</a> and will refer to it and the <em>Implementing Responsive Design</em> book (Kadlec, 2013).
<h3><strong>More timeline examples</strong></h3>
I found <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/about"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this timeline by DuckDuckGo</a> and it has completed shifted my thinking in terms of what is possible with a combination a horizontal timeline and a vertical layout site. This could be a really good direction to take with the design. I love the deceivingly simple design and the content is also pleasingly responsive. Having dug into the coding a bit, I love that the timeline itself if actually composed from a series of squares with ""border-radius: 100%"" in the CSS. No IE9 support and it is CSS3, sitting at just over 93% supported (according to caniuse.com: <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=border-ra"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://caniuse.com/#search=border-ra</a>). If Dr. Fotis likes this layout then I shall look at whether I can adapt what I have so far to a horizontal layout with targets&lt;fn&gt;It is really hard to tell what DuckDuckGo are doing in terms of the .js I can't tell which library they are using, if any.&lt;/fn&gt;. My only criticism with this timeline is that you want to click on the <em>year</em> bubbles and they do not do anything.
Here are some examples of infographics from the British Medical Journal, which might be helpful:
<strong>The BMJ timeline:

<strong>Vertical timeline infographics </strong>- some nice examples here:

<strong>Vertical typeface timeline </strong>- I like the very clear layout for this one, even if it not the most information-rich example: <a href=""http://www.minespress.com/timeline-of-10-famous-fonts-infographic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.minespress.com/timeline-of-10-famous-fonts-infographic/</a>
<strong>Horizontal timeline design </strong>- I'm not a fan of stock chart designs, but this one is eerily reminiscent<strong> of my own design for the anxiety levels - worth mentioning as I am not copying it!:</strong> <a href=""https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-illustration-timeline-infographic-flat-design-template-infographics-growth-image41562210"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-illustration-timeline-infographic-flat-design-template-infographics-growth-image41562210</a>
<h4><strong>A journey down the wrong path</strong></h4>
I investigated using javascript to dynamically resize the the coloured box sections based on browser window size. I thought this would be a good plan as I want the <strong>next</strong> buttons to appear in the same place on the page regardless of screen/window size. It became apparent that this was not the correct approach and having spent a reasonable amount of time pursuing it. JQuery
Here are a few things that I found along the way.
Textarea auto resize vanilla javascript - this could well be useful in the future: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/ugin/5779160"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gist.github.com/ugin/5779160</a>
This is sort of cool, but I am not sure of when/if I would need it (removing, resizing and snapping windows): <a href=""https://codepen.io/zz85/post/resizing-moving-snapping-windows-with-js-css"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://codepen.io/zz85/post/resizing-moving-snapping-windows-with-js-css</a>
Tried to use querySelectorAll but couldn't get it working correctly:
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll</a>
box-sizing - I just found out more about this which was helpful and spent some time checking out Marcus' example responsive site:
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing
</a>Marcus' example: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://itsuite.it.brighton.ac.uk/mw159/demo/responsive/
</a>I realised that I definitely needed a border-box due to everything needing to be inside the box! At close to 98% supported, that isn't too bad (<a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=border-box"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://caniuse.com/#search=border-box</a>).
Useful site that I found and believe Marcus also recommended, youmightnotneedsjquery.com:
<a href=""http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#outer_height"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#outer_height</a>
This is also a useful snippet to keep hold of for later as it could be helpful for calculations. I tried it in the Google Chrome console:
<a href=""https://gist.github.com/joshcarr/2f861bd37c3d0df40b30"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gist.github.com/joshcarr/2f861bd37c3d0df40b30

This led me to find out more about window.innerHeight: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight</a>
I ended up using viewport height (""vh"") for now but it might not be a robust solution at only <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=vh"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">82.55% support</a> (at the time of writing). It is CSS3 value and will have some compatibility issues: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1575141/make-div-100-height-of-browser-window"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1575141/make-div-100-height-of-browser-window</a>

The <em>time</em> arrived, as displaying data was something that seemed important from the beginning, to support the goals for the project. I wanted to support the information about 'UK smart device ownership' with some data.
Having spent quite a bit of time <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/24/on-the-importance-of-self-discipline/"">looking at polling options </a>and trying things out, I felt sure that the the Google Charts api (n.d.) would give me the level of interactivity and customisation required.
<!--more-->
<h3>Something I changed</h3>
Like the tools I had used already (see earlier entries including Flickity by metafizzy (2016), smooth-scroll by cfernandi (2016)) the instructions always say to call the JavaScript package in the header. This is something that my instructor, Marcus, had pointed out as bad practice. Therefore, I created a new eventlistener in my JavaScript file in order to load google's ""loader.js"" script. This allowed me to place the &lt;script&gt; tag at the bottom of my index.html file. However, unlike the other widgets and code snippets that I have used, I cannot compile Google's JavaScript as part of my own script (Google, 2016a), it has to be loaded from Google servers (licensed under Apache license version 2.0 (2004) ). For this reason I reused the loading GIF from the contact form, to show while the chart loads.
The data itself is from Offcom's report entitled, The Communications Market, 5 Internet and Online Content (2016a, p. 191). What is great about their site is that they make the raw data available in Microsoft Excel format, so I was able to construct the chart based on a subset of data (Ofcom, 2016b). In order to show the age versus ownership I selected a stacked barchart as a space efficient way to show the data.
<h3>Prepping the chart for print</h3>
I have still to create my print stylesheet, which is something that I will do towards the end of the project. In the meantime it made sense to make sure that the chart was prepped for printing to png. I am not going to make a link to the png available as that function will run in browsers which support the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element (Google, 2016c). However, what customising this script did do, was create a static view of the chart showing it in suitable format for printing.
<h3>Tab clear</h3>
I decided that I needed to highlight the User Experience section of the portfolio page design, as it was all very wordy. There is still a lot to consider in this area, but I decided to add a tab image on the top-left of the UX factors (formerly scenarios) section. I started by creating an svg, partially inspired by a post on CSS-Tricks (Coyier, 2013). However, I really wasn't happy with it in terms of formatting and scaling. For now I have replaced it with a tab which I created using pure CSS. The tab is actually made of two divs, one for the the main tab shape (rounded rectangle) and one for the slant leading up to it using the skewX transform option. However, I will have to replace this as it is only compatible with IE11 or later (Can I use, 2016). It is a shame, but it was good to learn about the transform option and again I used the ::before pseudo element to add text content on the div.

Ultimately, I will need to go back to an svg solution, but I will draw it to look like what I came up with using the CSS.

In this wireframe, I took ideas from wireframes 0 and 1, but removed the next buttons in favour of a timeline at the top of the page. The top section of the page, containing the timeline, is shown as overflow (beyond the width) of the page to indicate the dynamic content. Clicking on the <em>years</em>, and circles on the timeline is intended to swap out the slide content and information in the centre of the timeline section. The arrow buttons on the left and right were also intended to switch between the content slides. These buttons ideally would also be operable via arrow keys on the keyboard.

The new iteration of the design seemed cleaner and more focused in the sense that any page visitor would be immediately be shown the patient's story as an interactive narrative. However, this also meant that all my prior work on the smooth scrolling was for naught. I did try to see if I could tweak it to go from left-to-right or rather back and forth, but that was a futile effort.
A related attempt at this was to look at transition whether I could build the timeline itself in CSS by creating a &lt;div&gt; for the line itself and a &lt;div&gt; for the timeline circles but adding them as squares and then using the border-radius at 100% made them into circle. As you can see from the video below, this is ended in a vomit-inducing interface.

Further to this as I was influenced by the DuckDuck About page's interactive timeline (Titlow, 2014) I recreated it locally on mydevelopment computer. I then added it to my web space using the source files - stripping all that I could until it was only the timeline. However, I discovered that the coding and structure was not idea for this project. The code (CSS and Javascript particularly) had a lot of vague naming making it hard to follow and there was a LOT to strip out. So, the search for a solution continues, I think that I need to take a different approach to this problem...
<h3>Considering colour</h3>
Upon looking at a number of medical websites for journals, professional bodies and organisations including:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx"">NHS choices</a> (blue/orange/green)</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.nmc.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nursing and Midwifery Council</a> (dark blue, aquamarine, pink and lavender purple)</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.rcm.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Royal College of Midwives</a> (dark blue, two hues of light blue, white, purple and grey)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.nursingtimes.net/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nursing Times</a> (dark blue, aquamarine and white)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://journals.rcni.com/journal/ns"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nursing Standard</a> (scrubs green, two hues of dark blue, grey and orange for callouts)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/current"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Lancet</a> (purple, blue, green - a lot of white space)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.msf.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Médecins Sans Frontieres</a> (red and black&lt;fn&gt;An outlier with the red and black theme, however this would underline the critical nature of the work they do providing aid in emergency situations.&lt;/fn&gt;)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.bmj.com/thebmj"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The British Medical Journal</a> (blue and white, orange callouts)</li>
</ul>
The colour schemes contain a lot of blue and this influenced me to look at some different colour combinations. I used the palletton colour selector web application (<a href=""http://paletton.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://paletton.com/</a>) to try a few bold colour combinations. I also tried it with some vision simulations (available on the bottom right) to see how the contrast behaved for different types of colour blindness. The swatches below show one of the better combinations I came up with, although it still needs work.
[caption id=""attachment_190"" align=""alignnone"" width=""400""]<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/11/20/wireframes-2/01palettonswatches/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-190""><img class=""size-full wp-image-190"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/01palettonswatches.jpg"" alt=""Image showing a colour scheme created using paletton"" width=""400"" height=""80"" /></a> Paletton colour scheme 1[/caption]
The challenge with this medical site is that I feel I need to avoid a number of colours that may evoke negative associations. For example, hues of red might suggest blood and certain hues of yellow should be avoided due to the <em>hospital-yellow</em> association. The blues above seemed a bit dark, so I tried some lighter hues for Wireframe 2, paying attention to the contrast between the text colour and the background colour.

<!--more-->
The grid turned out fairly well although there are some very slight issues with the column alignment which I need to sort out. I also still need to add the mobile device break points. I did find it very helpful to make use of the CSS calc() function to actively resize widths in percentages based on window size (calc()., 2016). This is a fantastic function although the support for it isn't universal yet (82.73 according to caniuse.com). Having said that I did try my grid in Safari to see how it behaved in an unsupported browser and I was pleased with how well it resized.

793,1,25/11/2016 18:00,25/11/2016 18:00,"After a lot of consideration, struggle and annoyance I finally gave in and decided to use a pre-existing tool for the timeline section of my front page. I looked a few different contenders in this final pass. Essentially, I came to the realisation that I would not be able to learn the requisite Javascript in order to build something sophisticated enough from scratch. I did a bit of trying out in this jsFiddle project, but kept running into deadends (this project is in a partially built state - so please do not judge me - the javascript is largely erased by this point): <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/43gg6x3v/7/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://jsfiddle.net/43gg6x3v/7/</a>

Initially I found only jQuery examples - but as I have previously stated, I really wanted to work with Vanilla Javascript, due to load times, future proofing the code content. I also feel that it will be more beneficial to my learning to stick to learning Vanilla Javascript (or rather Ecmascript 6) so that I truly <em>get</em> the language prior to becoming too invested in specific frameworks.
Also having looked at these two resources: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/liamcurry/2597326"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">jQuery vs. Javascript gist</a> and then the From <a href=""https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/from-jquery-to-javascript-a-reference--net-23703"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">jQuery to Javascript: A Reference</a> - vanilla makes much more sense to me.

</ol>
After looking at these and searching quite a bit, I came across a tool called lory (<a href=""http://meandmax.github.io/lory/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://meandmax.github.io/lory/</a>). It is essentially a code package or widget for creating interactive slideshows or gallery. I thought that there might be some milleage in creating a slideshow or gallery and somehow customising it as a timeline. After testing I found that lory also was overly complex for my needs.
Then I came across a really helpful article about a widget tool called <a href=""http://flickity.metafizzy.co/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Flickity</a> on css-tricks.com (<a href=""https://css-tricks.com/creating-responsive-touch-friendly-carousels-with-flickity/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://css-tricks.com/creating-responsive-touch-friendly-carousels-with-flickity/</a>). It was love at first sight! Here is an example on codepen showing how the Flickity slideshow originally looked: <a href=""http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/bNLGNZ"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/bNLGNZ</a> - Flickity is both responsive and touch optimised and had a vanilla option in addition to jQuery. It seemed like a good solution.
Before my modifications:
<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/11/25/timeline-tool-identified/flickityorig/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-213""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-213 size-large"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/flickityorig-1024x239.png"" alt=""Screenshot of the freescroll Flickity slide carousel"" width=""840"" height=""196"" /></a>
After my modifications:
<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/11/25/timeline-tool-identified/flickityedit/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-214""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-214"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/flickityedit.png"" alt=""Screenshot showing the edited version of the Flickity carousel"" width=""952"" height=""414"" /></a>
Main modifications were:
- the timeline-line- size of slides
- outlines for references
- big dots on the timeline (need to figure out how to label these)
- overflow to ensure that the content doesn't wrap strangely on a mobile device.
There is still a lot to do and I need to fix an issue when the keyboard keys, when used for navigation make the web page scroll-right in a strange way. I also need to unite this with the other parts of the page that I have started to build.
Finally, Flickity is a paid solution unless it is used under a <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GPLv3 license</a>. I am passionate about open source and was already licensing my work under an <a href=""https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MIT license</a> so I have decided to set the rest of my project to <a href=""http://flickity.metafizzy.co/license.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">comply with the GPLv3 license</a>. This means that the license information needs to be included in the header of each source file. As the portfolio site will not contain any original research and will only provide an overview of the project this will also comply with the University's Intellectual Property rules&lt;fn&gt;As a student and employee I need to be aware of the university's Intellectual Property rules, which are available here: <a href=""https://staff.brighton.ac.uk/ease/ip/Pages/IP-Information.aspx"">https://staff.brighton.ac.uk/ease/ip/Pages/IP-Information.aspx</a> . However as portfolio site will not provide software with potential for commercial value and the project information itself is in the early stages it complies with the rules.&lt;/fn&gt;. Also in the markup of the html, CSS and Javascript I have indicated where pieces of code have come from and if/when licenses apply.
<strong>Update:</strong>
Shortly after writing this post I solved the issues outlined above (see: ""There is still a lot to do..."") and these discoveries are outlined in the next couple of posts. I realise that I forgot to mention how I solved the issue of the number labels on the dots below the Flickity carousel. This problem turned out to offer me a very valuable lesson in the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before"">pseudo element ""before::"" or ""before:""</a>. I have used the former, ""before::"" as this was introduced in CSS3 and is compatible with IE9 based on my testing.
I figured out that the dots themselves could be used as a counter-increment for the addition of the number labels.
<code>.dot {
position: relative;
overflow: hidden;
display: inline-block;
width: 40px;
height: 40px;
margin: 0 20px;
background: #a9a9a9;
border-radius: 50%;
cursor: pointer;
<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">counter-increment: flickity-page-dots;</span>
}</code>
<code>.dot::before {
display: block;
text-align: center;
<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">content: counter(flickity-page-dots);</span>
padding-top: 11px;
font-size: 20px;
color: #FFF;
}</code>
As the dots themselves are automatically produced by the Flickity Javascript, this meant that my number labels were now produced too. A nice solution.

My goal for this work-weekend is to try and get all of my <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">bits together in order to present a semblance of a whole</a>.
Things that I have fixed/done this week...
<!--more-->
<ol>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>The irritating arrow scroll issue</strong> when using keyboard keys to navigate the Flickity image carousel (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-label"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">aria-labelled accessibility controls</a>). Solution: I created a new version of the flickity.js and found the section pertaining specifically to the accessibility controls (keycode == 39 and event.preventDefault&lt;fn&gt;Marcus gave me a hint for this one, but I needed to give the code a thorough mental and literal work through to ensure that I was putting it in the correct place.&lt;/fn&gt;).</li>
 	<li><strong>Looked at the grid widths again</strong>, I think that these are approaching completion. It will still be a big job to implement the grid on my new portfolio page.</li>
 	<li><strong>Started to sort out media queries</strong>. Initially, I had thought that mobile first would be best, but considering the work domain of my primary user audience (nurses) it needs to operate optimally for desktop and be adjusted for mobile. My grid design will help to make this possible.</li>
 	<li><strong>Navigation</strong> - I created a prototype version of the navigation. I am not particularly happy with it as it is reliant on browser respect of the z-index property in CSS. Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer 9 are respecting the layering, Safari is not. The navigation has been given a fixed position so that is floats down the page with the user. The navigation links take the user to different sections of the page&lt;fn&gt;sections are literally HTML 5 sections, this will require a bit of fix-up code for browsers that do not support that, e.g. <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines#Using_HTML5_elements_in_non-HTML5_browsers"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines#Using_HTML5_elements_in_non-HTML5_browsers</a>&lt;/fn&gt;. I like the styling of <a href=""http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QGQPmX"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this navigation example on codepen</a> and might see if I am do something more like this as my current navigation feels a bit retro (complete with a:active and a:hover).</li>
 	<li><strong>For the navigation transitions</strong> I initially looked at whether I could reuse my work on the vanilla js smooth-scroll function. I did some reworking for the scrolling to work in the vertical, rather than horizontal but it proved unwieldy and did not work at all in Internet Explorer. After looking at a few options, almost all of them reliant on JQuery (as is the case with the navigation example above). I settled on <a href=""https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">C. Ferdinandi's Smooth-Scroll script on github</a> as it is based on vanilla.js and <em>span id</em> which searches for a specified tag id. Something based on tag id as opposed to specified regions seems more durable as the regions will constantly change based on the responsive layout. I did encounter some issues with exactly where the <em>span id</em> should be placed in relation to the sections. I'm sure that this is something that I can resolve by taking a closer look at the documentation.</li>

In fact I ended up recalculating the whole thing and basing it on a single column being 65px or 6.5% in width. Happily it is now working exactly as I need it to (Mozilla Developer Network saved the day again&lt;fn&gt;<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids#Creating_a_fluid_grid"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids#Creating_a_fluid_grid</a>&lt;/fn&gt; - I am going to up my donation this year).

<h3>I am feeling griddy</h3>
Now that my grid is in situ, I am able to base layout elements on  it. I do think that in most cases I will need to make unique versions of the columns and tweak the row layout, but keeping the grid architecture in place and temporarily adding the rows/columns to the html has been really helpful for planning out the sections (as shown in the screenshot below). I used my grid to start planning the layout of the content on the Flickity carousel cells - as it turns out this took quite a bit of work (more on that in my next post). I also had my first go at creating an SVG, albeit a very simple one as a placeholder for the first cell in the carousel. The SVG shows the outline of a head and I made it in Adobe Illustrator, this will need to be replaced by more of a photographic image for needs of the project.
<h3>about-About</h3>
Adding in an <em>About</em> section as the timeline really jumps right into talking about the fictional <em>Patient</em>. I will need to update the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQNj8SiUKWqBOTRTo5rnLcG8NxToeAJ7B9Q1eWWRDdl-_Z-dCbCG-E8xzjOhSWc86TWtNntOcL7K84F/pub"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">task list</a> to reflect this, but it remains within the bounds of the tasks as task scenario 1 included, ""<span class=""c0"">Read introductory information"", this needs to become task scenario 2 and the others need to be bumped up. I also need to revise things where they are <em>areas </em>as opposed to pages, it is bit too specific at the moment.</span>
<h3>Testing in Internet Explorer 9</h3>
I was astounded to find that pretty much everything on the site is working as one would expect in Internet Explorer 9. This is fantastic and vindicates some of the script selections that I have made in terms of browser support. I was very concerned that the z-index settings would not be respected, but thus far it is looking good. Safari is still a problem though...

<h3>Toying with the notion of animation</h3>
One of the sites that I have mentioned before, <a href=""https://gamificationplus.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">gamification+</a> has some pretty gorgeous and playful animations on it. I took a look through the code and the javascript attributes and most of it is managed via CSS. This is good, although I would am concerned about browser support and also performance rendering. As a consequence I probably won't add these features. As a pre-check I used the Chrome timeline tool to record the processes on an older computer that I have at home and I felt that the impact on performance would be a problem &lt;fn&gt;the new features operate at the limits of what I want, timing-wise so I will need to see if I can optimise them further. I have already removed aspects of the code that is not used.&lt;/fn&gt;.

800,1,11/12/2016 22:48,11/12/2016 22:48,"I have been plugging away at the portfolio site with the primary aim of getting a semi-functional prototype version to Dr. Theo Fotis on Monday 12th of December. There is a still a huge amount of stuff to do, fix-up and streamline I will add these tasks to my Trello board.
This journal entry provides a rundown of the decisions that I have this week.
<!--more-->
<h3>Flickity carousel</h3>
I decided to make the <em>carousel-cell</em> 100% width due to the need for a more immersive timeline. What I mean by this is that I felt that the cells were too modular before and the greater width (formerly 66%) makes more sense in terms of showing the long anxiety levels .svg file.
I still have lot of work to do in terms of consolidating my JavaScript and CSS files into one of each and then also minimising my JavaScript file. One of the things that Marcus brought to my attention was that my script sources should not be loaded in the header of my index.html and that this was bad practice. They now reside under the footer, but this presented some new challenges. For example the smoothScroll function had issues loading so I added a new main.js file (this is will become the final master js file) and added a window EventListener and then added an init function - to initialise SmoothScroll after the load is completed.
The other issue is that Flickity Carousel for the timeline started to flash up momentarily as a column until it found it's <em>brain</em> (aka the script actually loaded). I actually only discovered this due to using my mobile broadband stick in a cafe and noticed the latency. The Flickity Carousel is currently initialized at the bottom of a unique flickity.js file&lt;fn&gt;I needed to keep the smoothScroll.js and flickity.js separated while I figured out how to get things working harmoniously.&lt;/fn&gt;. What I needed to do to solve this was to set the carousel opacity as 0 until the window has loaded and as the carousel is not a function in the same way as smoothScroll it was a bit trickier for me; there wasn't something straightforward for me to work with. What I ended up doing was adding a new variable for carousel immediately after initialising flickity (entails designating the css selector as a flickity carousel) and then applying a style to make the opacity 1&lt;fn&gt;I had to consult github for help with this as I was at a loss for a bit: <a href=""https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/269"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/269</a>.&lt;/fn&gt;. This is working nicely, however the delay or a white screen may be improved by a momentary loading GIF in order to explain what is going on for a slower connection - one to add to the to do list! I quite like the Buffer GIF animation and this helpful tutorial explains how to code something like this with an SVG file as opposed to GIF, I'll give it a go: <a href=""https://cssanimation.rocks/buffer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://cssanimation.rocks/buffer/</a>. Also due to the audience of this site, I think that it is important to include the word ""Loading"" alongside any GIF or animated SVG.
As part of the process above I added the cellSelector option to the carousel in JSON format, as initially I thought that I might want an EventListener. It seems that this might be useful later on, so I have left it in place for now.
e.g.
<code>data-flickity='{ ""cellSelector"": "".carousel-cell"", ""freeScroll"": true}'</code>
Another issue was with the customised Flickity dots (used for timeline navigation) was that I had set the position of their container to <em>absolute</em> and the overflow to <em>hidden</em> as a solution for smaller screens or browser windows (the dots disappear entirely on a mobile phone sized screen). However, I noticed a sort of ghosting issue as a consequence of the overflow.
[caption id=""attachment_245"" align=""alignnone"" width=""471""]<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/11/cellular-concerns/ghostydots/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-245""><img class=""wp-image-245 size-full"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ghostydots.png"" alt=""Screenshot of the dots with the ghosting overflow issue"" width=""471"" height=""154"" /></a> It is quite subtle, but can you see those little grey lines between 2 and 3 and also between 3 and 4? There be the ghosties![/caption]
I fixed this by adding ""white-space: nowrap;"" to the dots themselves so that the wrapping was disabled.
<strong>Result!</strong>

<h3>Here be the stuff of nightmares...</h3>
I have to admit that I spent way too much time on this issue, but it was honestly driving me to distraction.
So having fixed my grid so that it was had even widths and looked lovely as I started to use my grids I found that I needed to add unique classes for the blocks that appear in each &lt;section&gt; of the html file. The grid structure is left in place as a logical point of reference.
Then I found that my written content in the grid was overflowing beyond the height of the sections. This was relatively easy to fix by setting the classes for the sections to have relative positions and have overflow set to auto. Phew.
However, as I added some placeholder content to my grid blocks I found that the widths were still perfect but the heights of columns were not okay. What I mean by ""not okay"" is that if a block had more written content then it was longer to contain this content. Therefore blocks positioned adjacent to each other looked askew.
<code>
/* tried this and hated it
.is-table-row {
display: table;
}
.is-table-row [class*=""col-""] {
float: none;
display: table-cell;
vertical-align: top;
border: solid 7px #EEEEEE;
border-radius: 0;
}
*/
</code>
This was strangely very hard to fix. I tried several methods. First I tried fool it into thinking it was a table, but I lost my gutter and I worried about responsive accessibility. I also tried CSS pseudo classes (which I now have a little bit of experience with after customising the dots), but it didn't provide the desired look either. I also tried adding attributes to the section container and the ""One True Layout Method"" (Coyier, 2010) where the margin-bottom is set to -99999px and the padding-bottom is set to 99999px and the overflow is hidden. This feels like brushing the problem under the carpet and it looks like it too as it cut off the bottom of my block outline and I like the outline. In the end I used row class for my grid defined to display <em>flex</em> and and then use the flex-wrap <em>wrap</em> setting. Alas, with one fell swoop my dream of full functionality in Internet Explorer is dashed as Flexible Box Layout module is not supported in IE9 at all (<a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=flex"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://caniuse.com/#search=flex</a>).
<h3>SmoothScroll and the Navigation</h3>
In an <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/04/moving-things-along/"">earlier journal entry</a> I had cited this fixed navigation example on codepen (<a href=""http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QGQPmX"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QGQPmX</a>) as being close to what I would like for the navigation on my site, however I have also been devouring a book on web accessibility, <em>Inclusive Design Patterns Coding Accessibility Into Web Design</em> and anything fixed in the CSS was identified as a no-no in the book (Pickering, 2016). I had also found that the fixed header height meant was causing issues with the distance of the smoothScroll function. I was able to fix this by checking their documentation and adding the labeling the header as <em>data-scroll-header</em> and then specifying this in the initiation script. Previously I had defined a spacer div for this purpose, it didn't work perfectly for the smoothScroll function, but it ended up being handy for defining white space between the timeline and the about area (in addition to the use of margin settings it was helpful to have something that was independent). In the end I didn't need most of this work as due to the advice in Pickering's book, I decided that the navigation header needed to have a relative position instead of being fixed.
<h3>Anxiety levels</h3>
As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, I wanted to give the carousel/timeline a long image that continued along the base of cells showing the anxiety levels of the fictional patient during the story (this was shown in <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/11/20/wireframes-2/"">wireframe version 3</a>). I started by testing with a .png image and as I anticipated it looked awful but I was most interested in getting the positioning setup correctly. The issue was that the image kept showing up above or in front of the text inside the description div. Also as the window was resized the image floated upward from its initial position. The only way that I could fix this was to use z-index and a fixed position for the image container (I already broke the rules about <em>fixed</em> items - see above) and then added a unique style id called #anxiety to specify how my image was shown in the container (as a background image). Initially I thought that I might need to specify one strip of the image per cell in the Flickity, but they kept overlapping and having layering issues. The logical approach in the end is to have one very long SVG. I need to optimise the SVG prior to the final release of the site, but at the moment I am still adding to it in Adobe Illustrator as I need to finish writing the patient story prior to finalising the graphic. As this graphic only serves an aesthetic purpose I think it is alright that it is both fixed and defined as a background image (and therefore cannot have an alt tag applied for accessibility reasons).
<h3>Bios section</h3>
I added box-shading to the photos - they needed a little something to differentiate them against the background. Once again this is not supported in IE9 although it is less critical than the flex-box issue outlined above.
<h3>Responsive adjustments</h3>
I worked on the mobile phone break point for the media queries first. Specifically, <code> @media (max-width: 414px)
</code>
I based this size on the Google Nexus 6P and the Apple iPhone 6 plus as although these are both phablet sized I certainly need the grid blocks to be shown in a single column at this size not in rows. In general I would like to steer clear of too many device specific breakpoints as it is better to think about the legibility of the design rather than get too obsessed this (an article by Justin Avery (2013) supports this view: <a href=""https://responsivedesign.is/articles/why-you-dont-need-device-specific-breakpoints"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://responsivedesign.is/articles/why-you-dont-need-device-specific-breakpoints</a> - not everyone agrees on this). Also, I realise that I need to go through the code and consolidate my classes and ensure that my units are standardised as % and <em>em</em> prior to doing too much work on this. So the rest of the styling and layout needs to be completed first, based on a desktop first mentality.
<h3>Thinking about the patient</h3>
I found myself rethinking the fictional patient's name, based on the ever helpful Wolfram Alpha. It seems that women named <em>Ruth </em>are demographically older than the fictional patient should be (roughly 55-65yrs although I need more data on this - more on this in my next post). Although Wolfram Alpha is based on demographic information from the United States it is a good basic litmus test for this. Here is my comparison, <em>Carol </em>may be a better name: <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=name+ruth+compared+to+carol"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=name+ruth+compared+to+carol</a>

Thankfully my decision to create a child theme has served me well as the updates were harmonious with my existing customisations. I don't think that I will be adding more plugins at this point, but I will go through my posts and ensure that the header hierachy is correct for accessibility reasons. I will also go through my posts and make sure that links open in the current window instead of a new tab, as this was flagged in both my accessibility book (pickering, 2016) and in Nielsen's <em>Top 10 mistakes in web design</em> article (2011). Also I will go through and review my heading levels as this was a persistant flag in the WCAG 2.0 inspections and it is easy to get it wrong &lt;fn&gt;e.g. h4 before h3 for some kind of aesthetic reason - I'm sure that I have done this somewhere without realising.&lt;/fn&gt;

<h3>Topic research</h3>
I have been engaging in quite a bit of topic-based research related to the content of the site. Most specifically the publication, <em>Making IT work: Harnessing the power of health information technology to improve care in England</em> (Wachter, 2016). This report highlights the need to empower patients to share their data with apps and wearables and also the need for interoperability. Interestingly upon a second reading it is almost like the health equivalent of the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy, which I have observed and supported through my day job (MacNeill, 2015). I will use this information in tandem with a statistical report which Dr. Fotis provided related to hip replacements (National Joint Registry, 2016) and broad reading in the perioperative subject area (see reference list in my next post) to create a story for the patient.
The good news is that Dr. Fotis likes the site so far, so I am on the right path.
<h3>Adding interactivity</h3>
In addition to the contact form that is mentioned in the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKRrdMlqlhcmzfVjdAwMEo5nUzuIYRhEgPgtR9giCgM/pub"">task scenarios</a> I wanted to add an easy way of visitors to add feedback. I thought that a poll might be a nice way of doing this. I investigated a few ways of doing this, but essentially I wanted to provide two options for visitors to choose from using radio buttons. Then store the values and display the results after the user had selected their option/choice. This turned out to be no easy task and I will compile all of my references related to this in the next post. As I writing parts of this post retrospectively I can say that I was working on parts of this poll, on and off, for the better part of two weeks.

<h3>Adding polling aka <em>feature creep</em> 16/12 - 24/12</h3>
In my <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/12/content-research/"">last post</a> I mentioned that I had decided to add a poll as I felt that some further interaction might be needed. I now realise that really a bit of a superfluous feature and upon reflection I have spent too much time on it.
<!--more-->
What I can take from it, is that I learned a lot about JSON and PHP in the process. This activity was really the textbook definition of feature creep or scope creep&lt;fn&gt;A handy definition from wikipedia just in case you need it: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep</a>&lt;/fn&gt;.
Here is a consolidated account of what I did and what I found out in the process.
I thought about using the fantastic Google charts tools. I could not, however figure out how to feed data into the chart, based on clicks of the options and then also how to store that information. Here is an image of a mock-up that I made during that particular phase.
[caption id=""attachment_265"" align=""alignnone"" width=""840""]<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/24/on-the-importance-of-self-discipline/screen-shot-2016-12-16-at-15-11-41/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-265""><img class=""size-large wp-image-265"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-16-at-15.11.41-1024x559.png"" alt=""Screenshot of site showing the chart in situ"" width=""840"" height=""459"" /></a> Initially, prior to the radio buttons, I was just using buttons to visualise the poll options. It looks nifty, alas it had no functionality whatsoever.[/caption]
Then I thought about creating a custom Google form skin as the front-end for a Google chart. There was some documentation on this (<a href=""https://github.com/heaversm/google-custom-form"">https://github.com/heaversm/google-custom-form</a>) and I referred to the excellent documentation from Google as well, but it wasn't the right thing.
Then as I use <a href=""https://www.polleverywhere.com/"">PollEverywhere</a>, a web application for polling, in my day-job I thought that using <a href=""https://api.polleverywhere.com/"">their API</a> might be a good way to go. Especially as their poll visualisation is very nice. I must highlight at this point that I wanted to avoid using an iFrame and have a solution that was integrated with the site. This is largely due to the fact that the iFrame content would almost certainly be blocked on NHS Trust computers (again this knowledge is based on my professional experience). The PollEverywhere API highlighted the use of JSON (Javascript Object Notation) for the configuration of polls. However, I have to admit that their documentation was a little beyond my own knowledge and I felt unsure of where to start.
I asked Marcus for his advice on the 16th of December and I also found a <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_poll.asp"">PHP AJAX poll tutorial on the W3Schools</a>. Normally I'm not a huge fan of the w3schools tutorials, but this seemed like the perfect solution.
I was able to build the poll, but the issue with it is that it is that it stored its values in a standard text file and this is a very insecure method. Marcus advised that I look at writing the values to a JSON file via the PHP and then pulling said values through html for the poll visualisation.
<iframe src=""https://mediastream.brighton.ac.uk/player?autostart=n&amp;fullscreen=y&amp;width=320&amp;height=260&amp;videoId=6325&amp;quality=hi&amp;captions=n&amp;chapterId=0"" width=""330"" height=""270"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe>
So I decided to see if I could adapt the script to read from and write to a JSON file instead. Easier said than done as the syntax from PHP to JSON confused me a bit. Marcus did a bit of troubleshooting on it too and this was very helpful to get on the right track. I finally decided that it was time to join StackOverflow and start asking and answering questions, here is the question that I asked: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41301335/json-newbie-permanently-saving-values-to-json-between-browser-reloads"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41301335/json-newbie-permanently-saving-values-to-json-between-browser-reloads</a> . The community were great and I got a lot closer to a solution. However, echoing data back via html in the php file proved too tricky and issue to surmount. I could get the one option to display, but I couldn't pull the previous results to display. This was immensely frustrating, to be so close and yet missing at the final hurdle.
[caption id=""attachment_267"" align=""alignnone"" width=""499""]<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/24/on-the-importance-of-self-discipline/2016-12-24_10-30-29/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-267""><img class=""size-full wp-image-267"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-12-24_10-30-29.gif"" alt=""Animated GIF showing the issue with the display of data pulled from the JSON file"" width=""499"" height=""349"" /></a> Animated GIF showing the issue where I could only display current data not pull the existing data from the JSON. The values update in the JSON but the html based on echoing the PHP does not.[/caption]
It was also really hard to debug the issues as a small change could take a few re-runs (despite hard reload and clear-cache reloads) to actually manifest and break it all.
Then I stopped and thought, why am I doing this? Sure, it looks pretty and adds an element of interest, but after working on <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1An9w8tBnoofrjyhXPfFiRBzAAvbo7uEQCgRG97lRJtU/pub"">the user characteristics list</a>, it hit home that I had been the victim of my own self-inflicted feature creep. The end users have very limited time to look at this site and probably wouldn't have time to contemplate the poll question. Furthermore, the poll question detracts from the content of the site. Finally it introduces additional security considerations and affects the life-span of the code in the site. So I have decided to archive what I did offline and continue from where I left off on the 16th. You live and you learn.
I shall now be focusing on an prioritised to-do list and I will deviate from my Trello board no longer.
<h3 id=""skipinfo"">Added a skip to content link for accessibility</h3>
Something that I have had on my list for a while was to add a skip to content link for screen readers and keyboard navigation users. I looked at how a few sites did it and settled on advice from the WebAIM site (<a href=""http://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/"">http://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/</a>). Although instead of positioning the content off-screen by 1000px I positioned it above with top:-20em. Although the WebAIM site recommends against positioning above due to the fact that this may cause a scroll off-screen, based on testing I have not found this to be the case and as Mozilla use this method (e.g. here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/50#document-main) and I am trying to convert all my units to dynamic values (ems or percentages) - it seemed like the way to go.

I added a <em>skip to content</em> link as part of my development of the core navigation in the site. This is assist those who use screen readers of navigate via keyboard. I was prompted to do this based on my previous experience with accessibility requirements and based on advice in the <em>Inclusive Design Patterns </em>book (Pickering, 2016).
<!--more-->
This was not as simple to accomplish as you might think and the resulting function behaves differently in each browser, however regardless the ""skip"" option is part of the tab-index as should enhance the navigation of the site.
Here is how it works in Chrome - not aesthetically pleasing, but satisfies the requirement. The video shows what happens when the user visits the page and presses the tab key, this reveals the skip to content button.

So up until the 24th of December I dallied with solutions for the navigation, but I had not really tackled the core issue. It was truly the elephant in the room, as so much of the mobile responsiveness that I hoped for my site hinged on the navigation working smoothly. I spent quite a bit of time looking around the web for inspiration, usually finding elaborate JQuery scripted examples; much as I found with the search for sliders/carousels. I really wanted to build it myself and resolved to create with CSS and JavaScript.
<!--more-->
The bulk of my inspiration ended up coming from the NHS Choices website's navigation (<a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx"">http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx</a>). It isn't responsive, but the styling of it says serious and health, so I thought what if I make a really responsive nav/menu based on a similar layout?
I also really didn't want to create a hamburger menu (the three lined menu icon used on many mobile/responsive sites). Personally I think that these are overused and when I observe folks try to use them in day job, they often lead to frustration. This is particularly the case for those people who do not use the Internet on their phones/tablet that often (they might have a few favourite apps though) or those who are new to having a smart device. It was reassuring to find that I am not the only one who feels this way about the <em>burger</em> (<a href=""https://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/"">Abreu, 2014</a>; <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/"">Pernice &amp; Budiu, 2016</a>). So I decided to go with a simple button labelled menu which expands or contracts based on the media queries.
To make this look nice I put in a bit of CSS animation smoothing for the transitions. Although I took inspiration from other folks coding (references are below and in the markup) the navigation is original. I decided that my button would trigger the header to become bigger or smaller based on an Active class in the CSS. I also had to figure out how to make the button toggle the active class (drew inspiration from this example for that: <a href=""http://codepen.io/razitazi/pen/WbZaOq"">http://codepen.io/razitazi/pen/WbZaOq</a> &lt;fn&gt;I must add that I did not add the class effect to the &lt;body&gt; and they did. I added it to the elements, I tried both but working with the individual elements worked better for my menu.&lt;/fn&gt;.
I also had to the solve the problem of the someone opening the menu and leaving it open and then resizing the page in a responsive web browser. This would just make the site look a bit broken. This was fixed in the end with a media query, although I did try scripting a solution with an eventlistener looking for the window resizing, this added to the processing burden as it would fire too many times. I also tried restricting it by setting it to look at the status of the menu, but the media query with transitions in the CSS was more elegant and worked in major browsers on Mac and PC (Firefox 31+, Chrome, Safari, IE9).
A couple of days later I made a return-to-top button, creating a new piece of script that used the smoothScroll function (mentioned in earlier posts). This allows folks viewing the site on a desktop or tablet to quickly return to the top of the page. This was inspired by a button on one of the <a href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearningteam/"">wordpress themes that I use in my work</a>, &lt;fn&gt;The button on this site (<a href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearningteam/"">http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearningteam/</a>) appears once you are halfway down the page. I didn't feel the need for quite as much animation so I kept my button a bit simpler.&lt;/fn&gt; I always liked it and wanted to create my own. I decided to alter and reuse the same svg, as the Flickity navigation button arrows. It is nicely minimalist arrow and is also design consistent (and I should add so much better than the arrow that I designed - below). Also I checked whether the svg code could be <a href=""http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-optimiser"">optimised further</a> and it was already as good as it could get.
<code> var anchor = document.querySelector( '#top' );
var topBtn = document.querySelector('.return-top-button');
var options = { speed: 700, easing: 'easeOutCubic' };</code>
<code>topBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
smoothScroll.animateScroll( anchor, topBtn, options );
}, false );</code>

<ol>
 	<li><strong>I developed and added the patient story.</strong> This was based on a characteristics list which I worked through rather vigorously on the afternoon of the 25th. This is still in handwritten form, so I will link to it as a google doc later on. I have included some key references for that process below. I want to highlight the National Joint Registry (2016) data, which was particularly helpful during the process of defining the patient story. Also the specific images that I used will be cited on the portfolio site (including cc0 works; royalty-free works) as I feel it is always very important to include the provenance of images in any context, but especially when engaging in a thought process based on a fictional patient/nurse interaction.</li>
 	<li><strong>I added images to support the patient story. </strong>These images were sourced from pixabay and one of my all-time faves, Creative Commons search as a means to filter Flickr images by license (<a href=""http://search.creativecommons.org/"">search.creativecommons.org</a>).</li>
 	<li><strong>I recreated the images that I found for the patient story as drawings in Adobe Illustrator.</strong> I wanted the images in the timeline to be small (100px x 100px); this is a limited amount of 'bandwidth' to communicate a visual concept. For this reason I decided to use Adobe Illustrator to trace the images and then re-paint them, so that I could accentuate certain aspects through the use of selective colour. This worked well and I did investigate whether these images could be included as svgs, but the visual information was too complex as they were based on photographic materials. As a result I stuck with .png format as the final output.

 	<li><strong>All of the images were optimised using <a href=""https://kraken.io/"">Kracken.io</a>. </strong>Honestly, I absolutely love this tool and will be using this from now on for all my images. Their algorithm somehow trims off the excess while keeping the core visual information.</li>
 	<li><strong>Accessibility. </strong>I ran an accessibility analysis on the site using the WAVE Web Accessibility Tool (<a href=""http://wave.webaim.org/"">http://wave.webaim.org/</a>). It is pretty good, I still have a few aria, alt and title tags to include here or there but I have made progress in this area.</li>
 	<li><strong>Infuriating. </strong>As someone who uses Reader View (I found out that this is the official name for it) mode in Firefox and the equivalent in Safari, I was very frustrated by the restrictive and arbitrary local style sheet implemented by this mode. I have spent way too much time customising how the site looks in this context, but it really mattered to me as this would really put me off a site. Also, focusing on it has highlighted the importance of the semantic web; the <em>reader </em>mode taps into the &lt;sections&gt; and other html5 element definitions. With a bit of hardcore tweaking, I finally have something that I can stand behind. The tweaking is outlined in <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/08/lots-of-changes-to-this-version-of-the-css/"">this development post</a>, however I found out by digging into the <em>reader</em> displays in the respective browser stylesheets that they will ignore certain css classes. Specifically I needed to implement a class called .hidden which is the container for the flickity carousel dots. The 'dots' are completely useless in the <em>reader</em> view and just look like an orphaned ordered list. I also instituted a .sr-only class which is applied to loading GIFs and other elements which should not be shown in the <em>reader </em>mode. All of this digging will serve me well for the print stylesheet, no doubt...</li>
 	<li><strong>I ran the Google mobile accessibility test on the site - It passed! </strong>Here is the proof: <a href=""https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly?id=W8x9QG2vBB-_NxSwy4fVLQ"">https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly?id=W8x9QG2vBB-_NxSwy4fVLQ</a>
There is still a lot of content to add, but it is great to know that I am on the right track.</li>

1011,1,17/05/2020 18:11,17/05/2020 18:11,"In February I shall be starting an MSc in User Experience Design and as a consequence my thoughts have turned to the study tools, which I wish to make use of as a student. As part of this process I have been considering my arsenal of apps. I'll likely talk about the full extent of my app choice plotting in future posts. In this post I shall provide my reflections on notetaking apps in-particular. In my experience early preparation has always been the best strategy when considering any new academic venture, so I look forward to sharing some of my findings on this blog in the lead up to and during my forthcoming period of study.
In my professional life I have become a devotee of <a title=""Evernote website"" href=""https://evernote.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Evernote</a>. I was not by any means an early adopter or rather I was but I got burned by a glitch circa 2009 which resulted in the loss on my web-based notes (at that time using it in-browser). I must stress that such a loss is not likely to happen with Evernote now but back then it was a relatively new thing and when on the cutting edge you may occasionally experience virtual paper cuts (thankfully I only lost a few notes)! However last year Evernote won my heart again when I decided that I wanted a solution with note tagging (keywords), multi-platform compatibility (in my case, Mac, PC, iOS, Android) and OCR capabilities (text recognition). After looking at a few app-based solutions it was the only option which gave me the flexibility I was craving.
In my work I have come to rely on Evernote as an excellent option for recording meetings and consultations, being able to send a record of what was discussed and any actions to a staff person immediately after the meeting. I then link this information to my to-dos in <a title=""Trello website"" href=""https://trello.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Trello</a> (I'll write about the wonders of Trello some other time). Sometimes when I'm particularly busy I quickly jot ideas or tasks down on paper and then use Evernote's document capture function to take a photo. I am always impressed by the OCR capabilities of Evernote when it comes to recognising my squiggly handwriting and making it searchable (the detects words in handwriting rather than converting handwriting to type). Also when you add in the photo annotation tools made possible through Evenote's partner app <a title=""Skitch App"" href=""https://evernote.com/skitch/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Skitch</a> I am one happy customer.
But...and you knew that this was coming, there is something to be said for handwriting and when it comes to deeper notetaking and truly learning concepts; I personally need to write concepts down to retain and understand them. When the iPad first came out in 2010 (Apple, 2010) I was an early adopter and one of the first apps I fell in love with was <a title=""Penultimate app site"" href=""https://evernote.com/penultimate/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Penultimate</a>. This app lets you draw or write with a stylus or your finger in virtual notebooks, later they added being able to add photos and voila it became a virtual sketchbook! I no longer wanted to carry a moleskin and an iPad and for a while Penultimate served me well for quick notetaking. Penultimate was acquired by Evernote in 2012 (Libin, 2012) and with that came the OCR capability of being able to 'search' your handwritten notes. However there were three functions which I have always felt are missing from Penultimate app which eventually caused me to abandon it. The first is the absence of a adequate notebook file management system, in apps like <a title=""Goodreader site"" href=""http://www.goodiware.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodreader</a>, <a title=""iAnnotatePDF site"" href=""http://www.branchfire.com/iannotate/#makepaperjealous"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">iAnnotatePDF</a> and <a title=""Notability site - Gingerlabs"" href=""http://www.gingerlabs.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Notability</a>, although more strictly for annotation of imported files, these apps allowed a far superior filing system. For example in iAnnotatePDF you can tag files with keywords, create folders and connect to Sharepoint (MyFiles) via WebDAV for backup purposes. In Penultimate, you just have an ever growing pile of notebooks.

[caption id=""attachment_75"" align=""alignnone"" width=""550""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/filemanagementiAnnotatePDF-2dgm3on.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class="" wp-image-75"" title=""File Management in iAnnotatePDF"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/filemanagementiAnnotatePDF-2dgm3on-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""filemanagementiAnnotatePDF"" width=""550"" height=""412""></a> File Management in iAnnotatePDF - showing the tagging function in practise[/caption]

The second issue is the background colour, from my <a title=""The Adjustment Bureau: The Case for Adjustment in Mobile Apps"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2014/09/07/the-adjustment-bureau/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">previous post</a> you'll know that background colour is very important to my efficiency when reading and writing. You do have the option of importing a photo to use as a background, so in theory that is a workaround and you can purchase notepaper types from Evernote Market, there are some good ones but these are more to do with line based layouts than page background colour. I have also found this <a title=""iPadPapers site"" href=""http://ipadpapers.com/tag.asp?tag=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">enterprising site</a> which allows you to create your own templates for Penultimate as well as use templates which other's have created, in particular I was happy to find a <a title=""Cornell PDF tutorial"" href=""http://lsc.cornell.edu/LSC_Resources/cornellsystem.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Cornell Notes format</a> template after the recent <a title=""MELSIG event page"" href=""http://melsig.shu.ac.uk/?page_id=645"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MELSIG</a> presentation about it. With any drawing/handwriting app, as a workaround, you could draw a template on the page, but then it becomes tricky when you need to cut and paste your written sections as the background gets confused with your written content.

[caption id=""attachment_77"" align=""alignnone"" width=""550""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NotesPlus_Backgroundcolours-2k8wz3p.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""size-large wp-image-77"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NotesPlus_Backgroundcolours-2k8wz3p-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""Notes Plus"" width=""550"" height=""412""></a> Notes Plus - the myriad of background colour and template options available in Notes Plus.[/caption]

The third issue is the lack of an adjustable on-screen wrist protector. Penultimate allows you to define your wrist position but as you will see from the image below, it has trouble deciding which marks my stylus is making and which marks my wrist is making. This was the deal-breaker, I'd be mid-flow in writing and half of what I'd written would fail to show up as in Penultimate's view my wrist had been doing the writing!

[caption id=""attachment_76"" align=""alignnone"" width=""385""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/penultimate_wrist-183un00.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class="" wp-image-76 "" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/penultimate_wrist-183un00-768x1024.jpg"" alt=""penultimate"" width=""385"" height=""513""></a> Penultimate - the effect of wrist shown. Also shown the excellent Cornell Notes template from <a title=""iPadPapers.com"" href=""http://ipadpapers.com/tag.asp?tag=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">iPadPapers.com</a>[/caption]

So after four years of on and off trial and error, with periodic abandonment of the idea of handwriting on my iPad other than using very helpful PDF annotation apps for small comments (another post about these apps specifically in the future), I think that I have finally come up with my ideal list of functions which a handwriting app needs - and one app fits almost all of them - Notes Plus with Notability taking a close second place.
<strong>My ideal list of functions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>File management</strong> and ideally creation of folders or notebooks for storage of different note types</li>
 	<li><strong>Background page colour</strong> and template adjustment</li>

<strong>Conclusions:</strong>
For written notes Notes Plus wins hands-down and it is also superb for combining PDFs, Word documents and written notes into self-contained notebooks or virtual binders. I have resolved to use it for the purpose of textbook related notes over the next few months. I'll report back on how it goes.
For decent notetaking and excellent PDF annotation Notability has clear benefits.
iAnnotatePDF's clear advantage over the other apps is its excellent file management &nbsp;system and also the ability to place audio comments in context within a document.

819,1,07/01/2017 21:08,07/01/2017 21:08,"I knew that all of that work that I did on polls would come in handy at some point. The <em>time</em> arrived, as displaying data was something that seemed important from the beginning, to support the goals for the project. I wanted to support the information about 'UK smart device ownership' with some data.
Having spent quite a bit of time <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/24/on-the-importance-of-self-discipline/"">looking at polling options </a>and trying things out, I felt sure that the the Google Charts api (n.d.) would give me the level of interactivity and customisation required.
<!--more-->
<h3>Something I changed</h3>
Like the tools I had used already (see earlier entries including Flickity by metafizzy (2016), smooth-scroll by cfernandi (2016)) the instructions always say to call the JavaScript package in the header. This is something that my instructor, Marcus, had pointed out as bad practice. Therefore, I created a new eventlistener in my JavaScript file in order to load google's ""loader.js"" script. This allowed me to place the &lt;script&gt; tag at the bottom of my index.html file. However, unlike the other widgets and code snippets that I have used, I cannot compile Google's JavaScript as part of my own script (Google, 2016a), it has to be loaded from Google servers (licensed under Apache license version 2.0 (2004) ). For this reason I reused the loading GIF from the contact form, to show while the chart loads.
The data itself is from Offcom's report entitled, The Communications Market, 5 Internet and Online Content (2016a, p. 191). What is great about their site is that they make the raw data available in Microsoft Excel format, so I was able to construct the chart based on a subset of data (Ofcom, 2016b). In order to show the age versus ownership I selected a stacked barchart as a space efficient way to show the data.
<h3>Prepping the chart for print</h3>
I have still to create my print stylesheet, which is something that I will do towards the end of the project. In the meantime it made sense to make sure that the chart was prepped for printing to png. I am not going to make a link to the png available as that function will run in browsers which support the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element (Google, 2016c). However, what customising this script did do, was create a static view of the chart showing it in suitable format for printing.
<h3>Tab clear</h3>
I decided that I needed to highlight the User Experience section of the portfolio page design, as it was all very wordy. There is still a lot to consider in this area, but I decided to add a tab image on the top-left of the UX factors (formerly scenarios) section. I started by creating an svg, partially inspired by a post on CSS-Tricks (Coyier, 2013). However, I really wasn't happy with it in terms of formatting and scaling. For now I have replaced it with a tab which I created using pure CSS. The tab is actually made of two divs, one for the the main tab shape (rounded rectangle) and one for the slant leading up to it using the skewX transform option. However, I will have to replace this as it is only compatible with IE11 or later (Can I use, 2016). It is a shame, but it was good to learn about the transform option and again I used the ::before pseudo element to add text content on the div.

Ultimately, I will need to go back to an svg solution, but I will draw it to look like what I came up with using the CSS.

<strong>Altering the Flickity Carousel/Timeline</strong>
So changing the height of the Flickity carousel used for the patient timeline meant that the ""dot"" buttons had to be moved upwards otherwise they would be off the bottom of the visible area on most standard screen sizes. For reference, I have included a long screenshot that I made of the site prior to this work, on the right.
So I decided that the dots should reside on-top of the carousel and then they would also be spatially connected to the navigation of the timeline. This is not really how Flickity carousels are really designed to exist (metafizzy, 2016), but it is closer to the original inspiration for my site the DuckDuckGo about page (DuckDuckGo, 2014).
The main issue that I ran into was that the carousel needed to resize itself dynamically and I had media queries which hid the dots on mobile devices (as they were no longer very useful as buttons at that size). However, as the dots themselves are rendered automatically by the JavaScript, they were rendering much more quickly than the resizing. So I upon sizing-up a responsive browser window the dots and timeline appeared on top of everything and looked awful.
I tried everything I could think of to fix this issue. I attempted to delay the dots in the JavaScript. I also tried writing a script which watched for the window size. I tried positioning the dots so that they moved upwards. I also tried creating condition code which watched for various conditions to be met prior to triggering the dots. Things I wrote worked to an extent, but not sufficiently or reliably enough to depend on them. In the end I had to temporarily hide the dots by setting them and the timeline to 'display: none'. I also had to hide the spot where they generated by moving the about section upwards. Essentially the solution's analogue equivalent is that the rabbit is being hidden in a compartment of the hat the whole time (oh wait...is that how they do it?).
<strong>Performance Issues</strong>
I am actually grateful that all of this happened as once I had cracked the rendering issue I realised that there were some major performance issues with the carousel/timeline. It took a bit of time to get to the bottom of it,  but in the end I realised that it was the long svg that I had included to indicate the patient's anxiety levels. Through testing in multiple browsers, on Mac, PC and mobile I realised that the image also wasn't loading anywhere other than in Chrome for Mac. Everywhere it was just gumming up the works.
I reassessed the need for the anxiety level gauge/image and decided that it was important to keep it. So through trial and error I ended up loading with an image tag in the html as a very, very long svg. This is the only svg in the site that I could not optimise as it resulted in optimisation errors because it was too long dimensions-wise. Also, I realised that I did not really want to optimise it as I would result in losing the drop shadow detail which I had added to a new version of the design.
<h3><strong>The new design</strong></h3>
The performance issues highlighted that the design of the patient anxiety-level link was in fact creating an optical illusion and making the carousel look guddery/jerky even once the problems with it were fixed. The new design not only looked more streamlined, but it <em>moved</em> more smoothly simply by virtue of its aesthetics.

<h3><strong>Space economy
</strong></h3>
This entry represents the end of a period where I added a lot of content to the site. This was a good thing, but it also meant that there were areas that felt overly heavy like the devices area. I decided to try adding a collapsible accordion as a container for the information, using a tutorial from Codrops (Mary Lou, 2012). The tutorial was bit old but I liked how it used CSS and I felt that I could build on it. The accordion looked quite nice too, I'm sure that you can sense a 'but...' coming on here? Well I will explain it in the next journal entry. I have however included a screenshot the accordion so that it can live on it perpetuity.

<h3>The contact form actually works now</h3>
<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/09/new-files-added-to-support-the-contact-form/"">I wrote a dev post about this</a>, but<em> yes</em> the contact form is now working as it should. I just need to enhance the warning/alert aspects and add aria labels etc.
And so does the back-to-top the button as in it only appears when one is sufficiently far from the top of the page for it to be useful. <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/18/got-rid-of-some-extras-and-wrote-some-new-script/"">This took a couple of iterations of code to get right</a>.
<h3>Finally...</h3>
I had come up with a CSS style for reference sections and I decided to add it to this journal as well as part of my custom child theme. I am going to <em>try</em> (time allowing) to add it to my all my posts retroactively, but it is a big job and I have surprised myself at the sheer number of posts that I have amassed here in the past few months.

This entry outlines key decisions that I made regarding accessibility towards the end of the development period. I am writing and publishing it retroactively as it as represents a very large amount of thinking and work, which I kept notes about as I went along.
<!--more-->
<h3>Based on observation</h3>
Based on looking at a large number of NHS and governmental sites, referenced in former posts I realise that accessibility is crucial, perhaps even more than your average portfolio site. For example, looking at NHS England (2017) site I see that they offer a text-to-speech service. Based on experience in my day-job working with software vendors, some of these solutions can be quite expensive. It was however important to me to make the site as accessible as possible and that has meant some sacrifices along the way.
<h3>Keystone texts</h3>
While engaging in this in-depth investigation into the accessibility, I found myself referring to the following keystone texts.
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles"">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) Roles Model (n.d.)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/"">The Paciello group's blog</a> - UX accessibility specialists an amazing resource</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility"">Mozilla Developer Network Accessibility Guides</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/"">The Nielsen Norman Group blog</a> - a frequent go-to of mine</li>
</ul>
I feel like I have only scratched the surface with the WAI-ARIA roles, but based on testing I feel that the site is accessible as I could get it within the allotted time. In the end I found a blog post on the subject by a rather brilliant developer, Aaron Krauss (2016) who did a great job of how to practically use certain ARIA labels and roles. What I did find is that there is quite a lot of redundancy in the code, but you need to have it there as the screenreader doesn't necessarily pick up the semantics in the page construction as you might intend.
Here is a video of my screenreader testing in action with tab key only - tabindex (Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)
<div style=""position: relative; padding-bottom: 56%; padding-top: 20px; height: 0;""><iframe style=""position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"" src=""https://mediastream.brighton.ac.uk/player?autostart=n&amp;fullscreen=y&amp;width=0&amp;height=0&amp;videoId=6936&amp;quality=hd&amp;captions=n&amp;chapterId=0"" width=""300"" height=""150"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe></div>
<h3>What the font?</h3>
I conducted some reading (Nielsen, 2002; Martin, 2009; Franz, 2014; ) around legible fonts and font sizes and optimal line height. I have tried my best to work with the best practices, although that does get tricky with the mobile screen size. However, the attention that I have paid to optimising the CSS stylesheet for plain readers should help those who use accessibility features on mobile devices.
<strong>Added a fix to the superscript</strong>
I found a very helpful snippet for fixing line height for superscript (used for references) and subscript. Thank you to the -ever helpful- CSS Tricks site (Coyier, 2009a).
<strong>Contrast</strong>
As much as I loved the white headers along the timeline the contrast was not sufficient. The colour scheme is themed around blues and purples and unfortunately white on blue doesn't comply with WCAG 2.0 unless the blue shade is very dark or the white font is very large (Snook, 2015; WAVE, n.d.).
<h3>The accordion had to go</h3>
Upon testing the tab-key only navigation I realised that there was no accessible way (that I could muster anyway) to navigate the accordion (Mary Lou, 2012) and for that reason it had to go. I added two simple tables, which I was trying to avoid, but as they area features comparisons this use us permissible. I was not using the tables for layout, but for the display of information in a standardised way. After the fact I found this accordion example at codepen.io which might have been better, but not without a lot of work: <a href=""https://codepen.io/stowball/pen/eZKwRv"">https://codepen.io/stowball/pen/eZKwRv</a>
<h3>Sprite fun</h3>
I got my sprite on and added sprites for the device images. The device images were drawings that I created in Adobe Illustrator based on photographs. All the photos were <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en"">CC0 - public domain</a> apart from the image of jeans, which I have listed below. This was added as an image through the CSS and aria-labelled for descriptive purposes.

<h3>Fixing the tab svg</h3>
I replaced the svg tab to be a proper thing rather than the Frankenstein's monster-like CSS creation <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/07/charty-mccharterson/"">I outlined in an earlier journal entry</a>. Once again I referred to the excellent CSS-Tricks (Coyier, 2013) and Mozilla Developer Network resources (2016c), as well as the Implementing Responsive Design book from the reading list (Kadlec, 2012).
<h3>Asking myself questions</h3>
I tried my best to standardise all the units in the CSS although if I were to do it all again with hindsight I think that I might design my grid to work with ems or rems (once they are widely compatible or older browsers fall out of use). I'm sure that I have missed things in spite of several thorough read-throughs. It all validated okay.
<strong>CSS code block structure:</strong>
e.g. div class or id - this resembles the layout of a div
.div {
display: block;
position: relative;
width: 90%
height: 60%
color: #000;
margin: 2% auto 2% auto
padding: 2% 4%; (shortenings used where possible)
}
e.g. typography class or id - this resembles the layout
h2 {
font-family: ""Helvetica Neue"", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
text-align: center;
font-size: 1.5em;
line-height: 1.25;
font-weight: 300;
}
In the HTML where white-space pre-line formatting was needed for the Goals and the references sections, I included comments to help indicate why the formatting was different in the markup.
Also regarding the CSS as I was going through it, to weed it a bit, I asked myself a series of questions to help determine which units to use and such. I have included these below.
<ol>
 	<li>Is it text? = ems</li>
 	<li>If it moves it is em or %. If it doesn't or cannot move it is pixels</li>
 	<li>Is it in a column in the grid - then margins and padding are percentages (unless there is a very good reason for them not to be)</li>
 	<li>Is it in the grid - then margins and padding are percentages</li>
 	<li>Is it used in the html? No, then get rid of it
Could it be consolidated in any way? Does it share the same values as another class and/or id?&lt;fn&gt;I would have liked to do more on this, but I ran out of time. Did my best to do it as I went along.&lt;/fn&gt;</li>
 	<li>Does it need to be a negative value (particularly in the media queries)? Then it is in ems.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Rationale:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>When it is something that needs to have set dimensions such as a button, I am using pixels.</li>
 	<li>For text I am using ems to ensure compatibility with older browsers</li>
 	<li>For table related items and blocks which reside in divs I have used percentages.</li>
 	<li>Used hexadecimal shortenings when it made sense to do so and it did not change the hue of the colour (three digits rather than the standard 6). I prefer digits rather than word descriptions, due to colour precision.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Media queries</h3>
Did a lot of work on these, again I found the Implementing Responsive Design (Kadlec, 2012) and the Introducing HTML 5 (Lawson &amp; Sharp, 2011) books particularly helpful.
I also added a arrow keys image and tooltip to help explain the navigation of the timeline. You will notice for the tabbed navigation of the site in the screen reader demo that the timeline is skipped over initially and I added to the JavaScript in order to allow the tab key for navigation in addition to the arrow keys. The arrow keys allow for greater freedom though, as once you have started tabbing through the carousel/timeline, you cannot get out of it with another tab press. Thus leaving it to the end and this is something for me to raise with the original developers to see if they can address that in future versions of the widget.

<h2>Goals for this journal</h2>
<em>""The posts in this journal will follow two reflective threads as I work through the module. The first thread is the development of this journal site, based on an independent install of the WordPress Content Management System or CMS (2016). I will outline my thinking behind decisions that I have take related to customisation and in particular accessibility and mobile responsiveness. These are the two key areas that I would like to learn more about during the module."" </em>-Yes, I believe that I have done this.<em>
</em>
<em>""...The second thread is related to the creation of my portfolio website. This part of the coursework will be coded from scratch and needs to rich in features, structurally sound and accessible.""
</em>- Yes, I have done this although it has been a very long road.
<em>""It is important to me that this journal’s theme is as accessible as possible,....""</em> - Tried my best on this, although I would have liked to do more with the visited links and some of the buttons.
<em> ""...based on the WordPress theme templates available. At some point down the line I may even create a child-theme in order to customise it to the necessary level. For this reason I need to spend a bit of time checking the coding integrity of some of the themes that I have installed to ensure that they are suitable for customisation.""
</em>- I did this and this site is proudly running a child theme.
<em>""...I have installed a list of themes filtered for accessibility features. Please bear with me, as in these early days, it is likely that this site might change it’s skin a couple of times while I decide on a suitable theme. I will also conduct some more thorough investigations using a local copy of WordPress and themes in MAMP (appsolute GmbH, 2016).""
- </em>I did this and also created a connection to my GitHub profile via Cybersyn plugin and setting up a RSS from my Atom feed.
I also provided options for user customisation through the use of the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/31/development-prototypes/"">stylesheet switcher</a> and the accessibility plugin.

In the narrative the <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">patient will be using an electronic wearable device to track their own vital signs and also for logging their anxiety levels</span> – the <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">influence of this countermeasure will be explored</span>. The narrative is represented through a <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">navigable timeline enriched with the use of graphical, written and statistical information</span>. The underlying project, to use wearable devices to measure patient pre-operative anxiety is attributed to and courtesy of Dr. Theofanis Fotis (School of Health Sciences, University of Brighton), whom I am collaborating with at this time.
<strong>Scope</strong>
The <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will:
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">deliver an approachable overview of a research project</span> – the proposed research project is to design a user interface for a medical wearable device to measure anxiety;</li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">explain the issues that can result from pre-operative stress in patients</span>;</li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">provide a point of entry for those with little or no knowledge of the subject</span> as well as explain the potential benefits of the project to experienced medical professionals.</li>
</ul>
The <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will not:
<ul>
 	<li>provide in-depth medical information;</li>
 	<li>provide any fully formed solutions or recommendations for implementation of wearable devices in a medical setting;</li>
 	<li>provide advice or suggestions for the production of patient care plans. As a narrative scenario it is exploring a hypothetical scenario in which a wearable device is used.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Benefits</strong>
The <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will provide the following benefits:
<ul>
 	<li>it will provide a valuable resource for explaining the research project to potential funders and future stakeholders; - <em>Hopefully in the future</em></li>
 	<li>it will help to raise awareness of the potential issues related to patient pre-operative anxiety; <em>- Hopefully if it finds a wider audience</em></li>
 	<li>it will <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">highlight potential ways that increased knowledge of a patient’s vital signs and self-reported anxiety could improve patient care</span>;</li>
 	<li>it will provide an <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">accompanying contextual information for the proposed future interface design project</span>; <em>- I have shifted my thinking it is more of a service design project.</em></li>
 	<li>it will be a publicity tool, that can be used to explain the project within the academic and medical online communities. <em>- Hopefully, again if it finds a wider audience.</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Goals</strong>
The following goals are related to the successful creation of the <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic:</em>
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">provide a valuable portfolio piece</span>, not only in terms of web development, but also as a tool for the research team and collaborators;</li>
 	<li>contribute to the approval and ethics approval of this as a concept for F.MacNeill’s final graduating project; <em>- Hopefully, I am about to start writing this.</em></li>
 	<li>stimulate dialogue around the issues and ideas raised by the <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic; - Hmmm, this may have been a bit ambitious </em></li>
 	<li>encourage potential funders and stakeholders to invest in the project. <em>- Hopefully...</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Objectives</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Create an <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">accurate portrayal</span> of a possible patient care scenario.</li>
 	<li>Provide <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">information highlighting the benefits</span> of the proposed project.</li>
 	<li>Pose the project concept as an open question in order to gauge feedback and interest from the medical community and potential funders and/or stakeholders.</li>
 	<li>The user audiences for this are diverse but have one thing in common, they have very limited time to engage with a website of this kind. This website should take no longer than <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">10-15mins to navigate</span>, the equivalent of a typical coffee/tea break. <em>- I have hopefully achieved this</em></li>
 	<li>To be shared via social media between interested parties. <em>- Did not get an opportunity to integrate any sharing tools.</em></li>
 	<li>To be <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">adaptive and easily viewed and navigated on mobile devices</span>.</li>
 	<li>To be <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">accessible to those on older web browsers (as far as possible)</span>.</li>
 	<li>To be <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">accessible to users with disabilities</span>, allowing for personal customisation (as far as possible). <em>- The customisation wasn't really possible in the end.</em></li>
</ul>
To summarise, I believe that I succeeded in my goals to learn about web development, accessibility and to gain domain knowledge about the perioperative environment in preparation for my future project.

<h3>Here is a quick list of the final finishing touches that I made to my site.</h3>
<strong>Revisiting the post about my last meeting with the stakeholder</strong> - <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/12/final-meeting-with-stakeholder/"">""I add some data to support this section""</a>
I added a google charts treemap to support the care section (Google, 2016). Using this as a way to show the comparative percentages between each of the different reasons. I wrote tooltips for the treemap to help with the navigation of the data I had to use html codes to make it work.
<strong>I added columns to the reference section </strong>(Coyier, 2010). However, I also found that the reference section was too long and ended up moving the section to a new page for those viewing from mobile devices. When I develop the site further, I will probably always keep a link to a separate page as NHS trusts frequently block pages which link to external websites. I might be able to get a university domain cleared for their whitelist though.
<strong>I added the icons for the goals</strong>. These were obtained from the Noun project and are cited on my new <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/key-resources/"">Resource page</a> which links up a lot of the artefacts which I have created as I have gone along.
<strong>I passed the mobile test and the validator tests</strong>. Although, the Nu Html Checker (validator.w3.org) took the opportunity to yell at me about the aria tags/elements: <a href=""https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fitsuite.it.brighton.ac.uk%2Ffjm19%2Fwearable%2F"">https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fitsuite.it.brighton.ac.uk%2Ffjm19%2Fwearable%2F</a>I tweaked them a bit, but decided to leave them as I had added them based on the results that I was getting from the screenreader.
Mobile test: https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly?id=4uQnwXr_vs07ixrqbFArEA
<strong>The print stylesheet was very tricky</strong>. I ended up having to omit the timeline in the end as there was no way to format it in context. I found some really good articles via Smashing Magazine in the process of getting it sorted though.
<strong>Media queries for tablet devices.</strong> I found some really helpful media queries on CSS-Tricks for this. Although the screen resolution in the queries was no longer compliant, so I had to remove that. This was important as I wanted to omit the tooltip and the keyboard navigation in from being seen on tablets. Based on experience iPads and Google Nexus (Nexi?) are the most used devices amongst the academic audience for the site.
<strong>Refresh button for data visualisations.
</strong>I found an onclick command (Lobito, 2015) for refreshing the web browser and I added this as a button. What had annoyed me was that everytime you resized the browser, the visualisations did resize, but they didn't update. This allows the user to refresh their view of the data.
<strong>Minify used to minimise CSS and JavaScript for the final production site files.</strong>
<strong>I realised that I did have a lot of content sections rather than articles.
</strong>I had misunderstood some aspects of the structure and realised that I needed to revisit the guidelines on this.

They were very helpful, but lead to some rather major layout changes. In particular, the <em>to do</em>: ""<strong>I will need more space in the carousel/timeline"". </strong>This led to what I nicknamed in my GitHub posts as the <em>Weekend of Hell</em>, I am softening this within the context of this journal entry to be the <em>Weekend of Doom</em>.

<strong>Altering the Flickity Carousel/Timeline</strong>
So changing the height of the Flickity carousel used for the patient timeline meant that the ""dot"" buttons had to be moved upwards otherwise they would be off the bottom of the visible area on most standard screen sizes. For reference, I have included a long screenshot that I made of the site prior to this work, on the right.
So I decided that the dots should reside on-top of the carousel and then they would also be spatially connected to the navigation of the timeline. This is not really how Flickity carousels are really designed to exist (metafizzy, 2016), but it is closer to the original inspiration for my site the DuckDuckGo about page (DuckDuckGo, 2014).
The main issue that I ran into was that the carousel needed to resize itself dynamically and I had media queries which hid the dots on mobile devices (as they were no longer very useful as buttons at that size). However, as the dots themselves are rendered automatically by the JavaScript, they were rendering much more quickly than the resizing. So I upon sizing-up a responsive browser window the dots and timeline appeared on top of everything and looked awful.
I tried everything I could think of to fix this issue. I attempted to delay the dots in the JavaScript. I also tried writing a script which watched for the window size. I tried positioning the dots so that they moved upwards. I also tried creating condition code which watched for various conditions to be met prior to triggering the dots. Things I wrote worked to an extent, but not sufficiently or reliably enough to depend on them. In the end I had to temporarily hide the dots by setting them and the timeline to 'display: none'. I also had to hide the spot where they generated by moving the about section upwards. Essentially the solution's analogue equivalent is that the rabbit is being hidden in a compartment of the hat the whole time (oh wait...is that how they do it?).
<strong>Performance Issues</strong>
I am actually grateful that all of this happened as once I had cracked the rendering issue I realised that there were some major performance issues with the carousel/timeline. It took a bit of time to get to the bottom of it,  but in the end I realised that it was the long svg that I had included to indicate the patient's anxiety levels. Through testing in multiple browsers, on Mac, PC and mobile I realised that the image also wasn't loading anywhere other than in Chrome for Mac. Everywhere it was just gumming up the works.
I reassessed the need for the anxiety level gauge/image and decided that it was important to keep it. So through trial and error I ended up loading with an image tag in the html as a very, very long svg. This is the only svg in the site that I could not optimise as it resulted in optimisation errors because it was too long dimensions-wise. Also, I realised that I did not really want to optimise it as I would result in losing the drop shadow detail which I had added to a new version of the design.
<h3><strong>The new design</strong></h3>
The performance issues highlighted that the design of the patient anxiety-level link was in fact creating an optical illusion and making the carousel look guddery/jerky even once the problems with it were fixed. The new design not only looked more streamlined, but it <em>moved</em> more smoothly simply by virtue of its aesthetics.

<h3><strong>Space economy
</strong></h3>
This entry represents the end of a period where I added a lot of content to the site. This was a good thing, but it also meant that there were areas that felt overly heavy like the devices area. I decided to try adding a collapsible accordion as a container for the information, using a tutorial from Codrops (Mary Lou, 2012). The tutorial was bit old but I liked how it used CSS and I felt that I could build on it. The accordion looked quite nice too, I'm sure that you can sense a 'but...' coming on here? Well I will explain it in the next journal entry. I have however included a screenshot the accordion so that it can live on it perpetuity.

Partially styled, but a nice efficient use of space. I would have added svg ""+""s on the right to indicate their interactivity.[/caption]
<h3>The contact form actually works now</h3>
<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/09/new-files-added-to-support-the-contact-form/"">I wrote a dev post about this</a>, but<em> yes</em> the contact form is now working as it should. I just need to enhance the warning/alert aspects and add aria labels etc.
And so does the back-to-top the button as in it only appears when one is sufficiently far from the top of the page for it to be useful. <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/18/got-rid-of-some-extras-and-wrote-some-new-script/"">This took a couple of iterations of code to get right</a>.
<h3>Finally...</h3>
I had come up with a CSS style for reference sections and I decided to add it to this journal as well as part of my custom child theme. I am going to <em>try</em> (time allowing) to add it to my all my posts retroactively, but it is a big job and I have surprised myself at the sheer number of posts that I have amassed here in the past few months.

882,1,24/03/2018 16:30,24/03/2018 16:30,"<h2>Why am I here (as in you, at this blog, and reading this now)?</h2>
I hope you are here because you would like an introduction to using RStudio for data visualisation. I also hope that you are here because you are interested in <a href=""https://strategyn.com/customer-centered-innovation-map/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jobs-To-Be-Done</a> (abbrev~ JTBD; Ulwick, 2016). This blog provides an example of how to apply one of the approaches that sits under the mantle of JTBD, an Opportunity Landscape (Ulwick, 2016; VIII. Target Hidden Growth Opportunities section).
<h3>What are we going to do?</h3>
We are going to create a plot, or Opportunity Landscape (SEE also Ulwick, 2017), based on data from a quick opinion survey that was distributed via social media. Survey respondents were asked to rate particular tasks that they regularly complete on a smart watch according to importance and satisfaction on 5-part <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Likert scales</a>.
At this point I should add a caveat, for those familiar with JTBD. These questions were not based on full <em>job</em> statements or stories but were abbreviated task statements. This is largely because based on survey testing, I found that the time it took to read and consider longer Job stories, based on Situation-&gt;Motivation-&gt;Expected Outcome (Klement, 2016) required too much mental effort for a &lt;15min survey. I have found Job stories to be indispensable at the interview stage, when derived from transcripts as a means to uncover motivations. In the context of this post I would say that my methodology is a bit of a mash-up of JTBD and Gerry McGovern's top tasks (2010; 2017).
<h3>Why are creating a plot?</h3>
I believe that the true purpose of any plot is to start conversations. Data visualisations have the power to both subvert truth and to challenge commonly held assumptions, I aim for the latter. Always.
<h3>Why are we using RStudio with ggplot2?</h3>
The beauty of using RStudio with ggplot2 is...well beauty. Most people can make standard Excel visualisations without too much effort, but even with a lot of tweaking they still have a heady whiff. In the past I used Adobe Illustrator, but speaking of my own failings it was too easy to leave the land of accuracy and enter the land of surface-treatment.
Here are my top reasons why you should consider using RStudio with ggplot2:
<ul>
 	<li>You know how to use Microsoft Excel, but would like to create better visualisations...</li>
 	<li>You have lots of data and you would like to segment it and look at a smaller portions without getting caught in a scrolling cycle-of-doom in a humongous spreadsheet...</li>
 	<li>You want something inexpensive - the only cost here is time, but it is well worth it...</li>
 	<li>Once you have built it, it can be used over and over and over...and tweaked quickly for whatever the need...</li>
 	<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> RStudio and gpplot2 can be used to prototype data visualisations for interface design and depending on your audience a realistic looking representation/visualisation could be very important.</li>
</ul>
If any of the statements above have piqued your interest then keep reading.
<h4>Step 1: Collect the Data, Show me the Data</h4>
In true Blue Peter style, here is one I made earlier...

[caption id=""attachment_884"" align=""alignnone"" width=""700""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JTBD_demo_image-1rd4pz7.png""><img class=""wp-image-884"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JTBD_demo_image-1rd4pz7.png"" alt=""Image of an Opportunity Landscape plot"" width=""700"" height=""560"" /></a> The plot above is based on Webcredible's fantastic blog post on the topic of JTBD <em>(Josephy, 2016).</em>[/caption]

I should add that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">your</span> plots can be much more extravagant than this, but essentially this is the basic type of plot that we are going to create to get started. The descriptive lines above are superfluous*. They are useful to keep commented-out in your code though as they can be used to create quick descriptive visuals for stakeholders when needed.
What we can read from the visualisation above is that I could have asked about a lot more <em>jobs</em>; it is a bit sparse, but 12 jobs is what this particular survey could accommodate. Also the majority of the jobs fall into the 'overserved' domain. This means satisfaction has been rated higher than importance and according to Ulwick (2016) this is prime territory for disruption. So although initially, when I looked at this visualisation I was like ""oh blast"", as I was looking for some untapped potential related to smart watch jobs and there is none. Actually it is more that customers are overserved for jobs that aren't perceived as that important and therefore the landscape is primed for some new competitor to come in and do the job in a cheaper and perhaps less good, but cheaper way, which though market adoption and iteration of 'said' cheap version may eventually lead to something better (Ulwick, 2016). Of course another dimension would be to ask questions about jobs that have not yet been considered for smart watch, but these were out of scope for this particular survey. In a way this plot perfectly sums up smart watches as they are still finding their footing, they are still superfluous to the smartphone which is almost ubiquitous.
The point I am getting to here is that this plot asks questions of the data, that we might not normally ask if we were looking at each question in isolation. It is only when we bring these jobs together that we reach a new level of meaning.
*Edward Tufte (2001) would likely frown to see these lines - ""erase non-data-ink"" (p. 105).
<h4>Collect the data</h4>
You will need a survey question something like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_display-w6adj4.jpg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-885"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_display-w6adj4.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of survey question"" width=""700"" height=""401"" /></a>
...Or split it into two versions of the same question depending on the allowances of your survey tool.
<strong>""DANGER, WILL ROBINSON!!!!""</strong>

<blockquote>Q: Hey didn't you say earlier that you need a 5 part Likert scale? But you only have four options in the 'satisfaction' scale above?</blockquote>
The answer is I had to take a difficult decision about the experience of users on smartphones using my survey. One more column and it was over the precipice into the land of non-function. As I am only interested in 'Quite Important' and 'Very Important' and 'Satisfied' and 'Highly Satisfied' in this context I sacrificed the final column.
So the results for the first question looked like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_result-qp4oul.jpg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-887"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_result-qp4oul.jpg"" alt=""Image of results"" width=""700"" height=""533"" /></a>
For the Satisfaction element, I created an <a href=""https://support.office.com/en-us/article/IFS-function-36329a26-37b2-467c-972b-4a39bd951d45"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">IFS Function</a> in my final spreadsheet, to make 4 equaled 5, 3 equaled 4, 2 equaled 3 and 1 equaled 2. This put everything on the same scale.
<h4>Download the data</h4>
Any good survey tool should allow you to download the results to CSV format (Comma Separated Values) and any survey tool worth its salt should also provide a SPSS or data analysis format which codes each response with a number. So in my case I wanted to the most positive response to have the highest rank value. I am going to use Excel to sort the data, as that is/was my comfort zone and I think that it is good to start from a position of confidence and trust in the original figures prior to visualising them. Personally speaking after only a few months of working with RStudio, I now feel happy to complete the entire workflow in RStudio.
<h4>Tip: Split up your Importance (IMP) and Satisfaction (SAT) onto separate tabs in your Excel spreadsheet</h4>
Believe me this will make your life SO much easier, when it comes to doing your calculations.
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sort-the-data.001-1jk68l1.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-888 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sort-the-data.001-1jk68l1.jpeg"" alt=""Image of sort data slide"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /></a>
<h4>Step 2: Do the Maths</h4>
Having separated your data, create a new tab in your spreadsheet and create the rows defined in the column labelled <strong>A</strong> below. Then use the data on your Importance tab to populate column <strong>B. </strong>Start with one question-worth of data, we'll get to the rest of your questions soon.
<ul>
 	<li>So for row 3 ""total importance"": count all the entries in the importance column for that particular job from the first data row to the last - indicated by A<em>x</em> [COUNTA].</li>
 	<li>For row 4 we want to count how many of these entries had a rating of 4 (Quite Important) and 5 (Very Important). So we use a COUNTIF formula to look at values greater than 3. As we aren't dealing with decimals (yet), ""&gt;3"" is accurate enough for this purpose.</li>
 	<li>For row 5 we need to find out what percentage of overall responses are <em>Quite</em> and <em>Very Important</em>. So we divide row 4 by row 3 and then times by 10.</li>
</ul>

</table>
<strong>Create identical rows for satisfaction</strong> (after in my case, adjusting it upwards first, due to having a satisfaction scale of 4 parts), so that you end up with this...
<h4>The Opportunity Algorithm</h4>
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/presentation.001-28jxl4y.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-891 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/presentation.001-28jxl4y.jpeg"" alt=""Image of the opportunity algorithm"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /></a>
So you will need a final row, row 10 to calculate the <strong>Opportunity Score</strong>. This is outlined above, but to explain the contents of the image. You take the outcome of importance, which is your percentage, so 9.6 in this case and take away the outcome of satisfaction, again a percentage. So that would leave you with -0.1, then add back on the outcome percentage which is is 9.6 and you end up with the total opportunity score of 9.5.
outcome importance +
(outcome importance - outcome satisfaction)
= Opportunity Score
9.6 + (9.6 - 9.7) = 9.5
This is not the most exciting opportunity score, the most exciting ones are more than 10, or better yet more than 12.
Oh and here is why I said that you should start with the formulae for one question-worth of data and to split Importance and Satisfaction onto separate sheets...Once you have created one column for Importance and Satisfaction data you can simply drag the formulae across all of your questions.

<h4>Create R Food</h4>
Having done all that you need to get your data into columns for RStudio, specifically we want four columns to start off with: Job; Importance; Satisfaction; Opportunity; and Score.
So that it looks like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/becalculated.001-1mbcuiy.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-892 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/becalculated.001-1mbcuiy.jpeg"" alt=""Image showing the columns in the spreadsheet"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /></a>
Tip to get your data from rows to these columns use the transpose(array) function in Excel, here it is in action...
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sCdz2fOSWAI?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
<h4>Step 3: Get Sta(R)ted</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Install R from the R Archive:
</strong>Pick a mirror close-by (geographically speaking), e.g in UK - <a href=""https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">University of Bristol</a>, <a href=""https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Imperial College London</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Mac tip:</strong> make sure that you check the MD5 hash and SHA hash match. You can do this quickly and easily in terminal.<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHdrIlHS2-4?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></li>
 	<li><strong>[Mac only</strong><strong>] </strong><a href=""https://www.xquartz.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">XQuartz</a> Install - information about this is provided at R Archive above.</li>
 	<li><strong>Install RStudio:</strong> again do check the MD5. You can get the installer here - <a href=""https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 4: OoooH aRrrrr</h4>
Launch RStudio and have a go!

So now that you have done all of the preparation you can actually start to create plots. Before you do anything else you need to load your library. In this case we are using ggplot2 which is part of <a href=""https://www.tidyverse.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hadley Wickham's (and others) Tidyverse</a> - packages for R with standardised concepts and grammar. This is a good place to start as I have found that some of the R packages are quite idiosyncratic and it can take a bit of time to wrap your head around the internal logic, whereas the Tidyverse stuff all made a lot of sense. This could be because I originally learned to code in the JavaScript iteration of <a href=""https://processing.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Processing.</a>
RStudio comes with a lot of packages already, so...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]library(gpplot2)[/sourcecode]
If you needed to install it first and say you wanted the whole Tidyverse it would intuitively be...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]install.packages(tidyverse)[/sourcecode]
Next you need to define your data and as you will recall we set that us as a .csv file on the desktop so lets call the data 'jtdb'...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]
library(gpplot2)
jtbd &lt;- read.csv(""~/Desktop/JTBD_R/jtbd.csv"", header = T)
#This is a comment in RMarkup, so lets also find out about the data itself by using the summary function
summary(jtbd)
[/sourcecode]
<strong>Result in the console:</strong>
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resultinconsole-t8dbkw.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-910"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resultinconsole-t8dbkw.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of results in console"" width=""515"" height=""339"" /></a>
Well...that is jolly helpful information!
<h4>Now for the plot part:</h4>
[sourcecode language=""plain""]
#the plot mapping - telling where your data to map on the axis
ggplot(jtbd, aes(x=Importance, y=Satisfaction))+
# the ""+"" allows you to add another function, each function goes on its own layer,
#so the order is important for example geom_point defines your data as points on the plot
geom_point(color=""blue"", alpha=0.5, size=4)+
# To map aesthetics in a more intentional way - for instance adding labels,
# we can use another function geom label which requires two variables
#(in this case Importance and Satisfaction)
# and tell it which column to get the labels from, in this case, the ""Job"" column
geom_label(aes(label = jtbd$Job), nudge_y = 0.08, nudge_x = 0.06, hjust=""right"", alpha=0.8, size=4)
[/sourcecode]
This gives a starter plot like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/star_R-244yio2.png""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-914 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/star_R-244yio2.png"" alt=""Image of starter plot"" width=""800"" height=""429"" /></a>
Just to prove that it is easy to get started I gave myself a little challenge...
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NJY0dQdV-7I?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
After that it is really all about the aesthetics with this particular plot. Specifically I added a data.frame (a container for data) for each aesthetic element such as text, lines, shaded polygons and areas. These were then called as shown below...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]
#Labels for the areas of the plot
labelover &lt;- data.frame(
x = 1,
y = 9.5,
label=""OVERSERVED""
)
#Potential for disruption line
segment4 &lt;- data.frame(
x = 0,
y = 2,
xend = 7,
yend = 10
)
#further down in the code where the plot is created - I call these#
ggplot(jtbd, aes(x=Importance, y=Satisfaction)) +
#Calling the text
geom_text(data = labelover, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size=5) +
#Calling the 'potential for disruption line' and adding some annotation to it
geom_segment(data = segment4, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend), alpha=0.2, linetype=2) +
annotate(""text"", x = 5.1, y = 9, label = ""Potential for disruption"")
[/sourcecode]
<h4>Step 5: Aesthetics</h4>
Well that provides an overview of the basics the rest will be based on your own aesthetic decisions. So I have provided the full code work-up with annotation below and recommend that you have a go and explore. Also if any of you are R and ggplot2 'pros' I am open to feedback as I am sure that it could be improved.
To summarise, from my perspective using RStudio has provided the following benefits:
<ul>
 	<li>A fast way to create reproducible visualisations of JTBD data</li>
 	<li>An effective way to create prototype data visualisations for a range of design contexts</li>
 	<li>An inexpensive option when compared to other data packages. Although I can get a student discount on software at the moment, I was thinking about the long term and developing a skill with an open source package</li>
 	<li>It has helped me to think differently about data and to iterate visualisations in the same way that I would with other design projects</li>
 	<li>It is immensely satisfying</li>
</ul>

917,1,17/05/2020 16:51,17/05/2020 16:51,"<h2>Why am I here (as in you, at this blog, and reading this now)?</h2>
I hope you are here because you would like an introduction to using RStudio for data visualisation. I also hope that you are here because you are interested in <a href=""https://strategyn.com/customer-centered-innovation-map/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jobs-To-Be-Done</a> (abbrev~ JTBD; Ulwick, 2016). This blog provides an example of how to apply one of the approaches that sits under the mantle of JTBD, an Opportunity Landscape (Ulwick, 2016; VIII. Target Hidden Growth Opportunities section).
<h3>What are we going to do?</h3>
We are going to create a plot, or Opportunity Landscape (SEE also Ulwick, 2017), based on data from a quick opinion survey that was distributed via social media. Survey respondents were asked to rate particular tasks that they regularly complete on a smart watch according to importance and satisfaction on 5-part <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Likert scales</a>.
At this point I should add a caveat, for those familiar with JTBD. These questions were not based on full <em>job</em> statements or stories but were abbreviated task statements. This is largely because based on survey testing, I found that the time it took to read and consider longer Job stories, based on Situation-&gt;Motivation-&gt;Expected Outcome (Klement, 2016) required too much mental effort for a &lt;15min survey. I have found Job stories to be indispensable at the interview stage, when derived from transcripts as a means to uncover motivations. In the context of this post I would say that my methodology is a bit of a mash-up of JTBD and Gerry McGovern's top tasks (2010; 2017).
<h3>Why are creating a plot?</h3>
I believe that the true purpose of any plot is to start conversations. Data visualisations have the power to both subvert truth and to challenge commonly held assumptions, I aim for the latter. Always.
<h3>Why are we using RStudio with ggplot2?</h3>
The beauty of using RStudio with ggplot2 is...well beauty. Most people can make standard Excel visualisations without too much effort, but even with a lot of tweaking they still have a heady whiff. In the past I used Adobe Illustrator, but speaking of my own failings it was too easy to leave the land of accuracy and enter the land of surface-treatment.
Here are my top reasons why you should consider using RStudio with ggplot2:
<ul>
 	<li>You know how to use Microsoft Excel, but would like to create better visualisations...</li>
 	<li>You have lots of data and you would like to segment it and look at a smaller portions without getting caught in a scrolling cycle-of-doom in a humongous spreadsheet...</li>
 	<li>You want something inexpensive - the only cost here is time, but it is well worth it...</li>
 	<li>Once you have built it, it can be used over and over and over...and tweaked quickly for whatever the need...</li>
 	<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> RStudio and gpplot2 can be used to prototype data visualisations for interface design and depending on your audience a realistic looking representation/visualisation could be very important.</li>
</ul>
If any of the statements above have piqued your interest then keep reading.
<h4>Step 1: Collect the Data, Show me the Data</h4>
In true Blue Peter style, here is one I made earlier...

[caption id=""attachment_884"" align=""alignnone"" width=""700""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JTBD_demo_image-1rd4pz7.png""><img class=""wp-image-884"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JTBD_demo_image-1rd4pz7.png"" alt=""Image of an Opportunity Landscape plot"" width=""700"" height=""560""></a> The plot above is based on Webcredible's fantastic blog post on the topic of JTBD <em>(Josephy, 2016).</em>[/caption]

&nbsp;
I should add that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">your</span> plots can be much more extravagant than this, but essentially this is the basic type of plot that we are going to create to get started. The descriptive lines above are superfluous*. They are useful to keep commented-out in your code though as they can be used to create quick descriptive visuals for stakeholders when needed.
What we can read from the visualisation above is that I could have asked about a lot more <em>jobs</em>; it is a bit sparse, but 12 jobs is what this particular survey could accommodate. Also the majority of the jobs fall into the 'overserved' domain. This means satisfaction has been rated higher than importance and according to Ulwick (2016) this is prime territory for disruption. So although initially, when I looked at this visualisation I was like ""oh blast"", as I was looking for some untapped potential related to smart watch jobs and there is none. Actually it is more that customers are overserved for jobs that aren't perceived as that important and therefore the landscape is primed for some new competitor to come in and do the job in a cheaper and perhaps less good, but cheaper way, which though market adoption and iteration of 'said' cheap version may eventually lead to something better (Ulwick, 2016). Of course another dimension would be to ask questions about jobs that have not yet been considered for smart watch, but these were out of scope for this particular survey. In a way this plot perfectly sums up smart watches as they are still finding their footing, they are still superfluous to the smartphone which is almost ubiquitous.
The point I am getting to here is that this plot asks questions of the data, that we might not normally ask if we were looking at each question in isolation. It is only when we bring these jobs together that we reach a new level of meaning.
*Edward Tufte (2001) would likely frown to see these lines - ""erase non-data-ink"" (p. 105).
<h4>Collect the data</h4>
You will need a survey question something like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_display-w6adj4.jpg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-885"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_display-w6adj4.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of survey question"" width=""700"" height=""401""></a>
...Or split it into two versions of the same question depending on the allowances of your survey tool.

<blockquote>Q: Hey didn't you say earlier that you need a 5 part Likert scale? But you only have four options in the 'satisfaction' scale above?</blockquote>
The answer is I had to take a difficult decision about the experience of users on smartphones using my survey. One more column and it was over the precipice into the land of non-function. As I am only interested in 'Quite Important' and 'Very Important' and 'Satisfied' and 'Highly Satisfied' in this context I sacrificed the final column.
So the results for the first question looked like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_result-qp4oul.jpg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-887"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_result-qp4oul.jpg"" alt=""Image of results"" width=""700"" height=""533""></a>
For the Satisfaction element, I created an <a href=""https://support.office.com/en-us/article/IFS-function-36329a26-37b2-467c-972b-4a39bd951d45"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">IFS Function</a> in my final spreadsheet, to make 4 equaled 5, 3 equaled 4, 2 equaled 3 and 1 equaled 2. This put everything on the same scale.
<h4>Download the data</h4>
Any good survey tool should allow you to download the results to CSV format (Comma Separated Values) and any survey tool worth its salt should also provide a SPSS or data analysis format which codes each response with a number. So in my case I wanted to the most positive response to have the highest rank value. I am going to use Excel to sort the data, as that is/was my comfort zone and I think that it is good to start from a position of confidence and trust in the original figures prior to visualising them. Personally speaking after only a few months of working with RStudio, I now feel happy to complete the entire workflow in RStudio.
<h4>Tip: Split up your Importance (IMP) and Satisfaction (SAT) onto separate tabs in your Excel spreadsheet</h4>
Believe me this will make your life SO much easier, when it comes to doing your calculations.
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sort-the-data.001-1jk68l1.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-888 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sort-the-data.001-1jk68l1.jpeg"" alt=""Image of sort data slide"" width=""1024"" height=""768""></a>
<h4>Step 2: Do the Maths</h4>
Having separated your data, create a new tab in your spreadsheet and create the rows defined in the column labelled <strong>A</strong> below. Then use the data on your Importance tab to populate column <strong>B. </strong>Start with one question-worth of data, we'll get to the rest of your questions soon.
<ul>
 	<li>So for row 3 ""total importance"": count all the entries in the importance column for that particular job from the first data row to the last - indicated by A<em>x</em> [COUNTA].</li>
 	<li>For row 4 we want to count how many of these entries had a rating of 4 (Quite Important) and 5 (Very Important). So we use a COUNTIF formula to look at values greater than 3. As we aren't dealing with decimals (yet), ""&gt;3"" is accurate enough for this purpose.</li>
 	<li>For row 5 we need to find out what percentage of overall responses are&nbsp;<em>Quite</em> and <em>Very Important</em>. So we divide row 4 by row 3 and then times by 10.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Create identical rows for satisfaction</strong> (after in my case, adjusting it upwards first, due to having a satisfaction scale of 4 parts), so that you end up with this...
<h4>The Opportunity Algorithm</h4>
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/presentation.001-28jxl4y.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-891 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/presentation.001-28jxl4y.jpeg"" alt=""Image of the opportunity algorithm"" width=""1024"" height=""768""></a>
So you will need a final row, row 10 to calculate the <strong>Opportunity Score</strong>. This is outlined above, but to explain the contents of the image. You take the outcome of importance, which is your percentage, so 9.6 in this case and take away the outcome of satisfaction, again a percentage. So that would leave you with -0.1, then add back on the outcome percentage which is is 9.6 and you end up with the total opportunity score of 9.5.
outcome importance +
(outcome importance - outcome satisfaction)
= Opportunity Score
9.6 + (9.6 - 9.7) = 9.5
This is not the most exciting opportunity score, the most exciting ones are more than 10, or better yet more than 12.
Oh and here is why I said that you should start with the formulae for one question-worth of data and to split Importance and Satisfaction onto separate sheets...Once you have created one column for Importance and Satisfaction data you can simply drag the formulae across all of your questions.

<h4>Create R Food</h4>
Having done all that you need to get your data into columns for RStudio, specifically we want four columns to start off with: Job; Importance; Satisfaction; Opportunity; and Score.
So that it looks like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/becalculated.001-1mbcuiy.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-892 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/becalculated.001-1mbcuiy.jpeg"" alt=""Image showing the columns in the spreadsheet"" width=""1024"" height=""768""></a>
Tip to get your data from rows to these columns use the transpose(array) function in Excel, here it is in action...
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sCdz2fOSWAI?rel=0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0""></iframe>
<h4>Step 3: Get Sta(R)ted</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Install R from the R Archive:
</strong>Pick a mirror close-by (geographically speaking), e.g in UK - <a href=""https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">University of Bristol</a>, <a href=""https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Imperial College London</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Mac tip:</strong> make sure that you check the MD5 hash and SHA hash match. You can do this quickly and easily in terminal.<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHdrIlHS2-4?rel=0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></li>
 	<li><strong>[Mac only</strong><strong>] </strong><a href=""https://www.xquartz.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">XQuartz</a> Install - information about this is provided at R Archive above.</li>
 	<li><strong>Install RStudio:</strong> again do check the MD5. You can get the installer here - <a href=""https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 4: OoooH aRrrrr</h4>
Launch RStudio and have a go!

&nbsp;
So now that you have done all of the preparation you can actually start to create plots. Before you do anything else you need to load your library. In this case we are using ggplot2 which is part of <a href=""https://www.tidyverse.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hadley Wickham's (and others) Tidyverse</a> - packages for R with standardised concepts and grammar. This is a good place to start as I have found that some of the R packages are quite idiosyncratic and it can take a bit of time to wrap your head around the internal logic, whereas the Tidyverse stuff all made a lot of sense. This could be because I originally learned to code in the JavaScript iteration of <a href=""https://processing.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Processing.</a>
RStudio comes with a lot of packages already, so...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]library(gpplot2)[/sourcecode]
If you needed to install it first and say you wanted the whole Tidyverse it would intuitively be...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]install.packages(tidyverse)[/sourcecode]
Next you need to define your data and as you will recall we set that us as a .csv file on the desktop so lets call the data 'jtdb'...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]
library(gpplot2)
jtbd &lt;- read.csv(""~/Desktop/JTBD_R/jtbd.csv"", header = T)
#This is a comment in RMarkup, so lets also find out about the data itself by using the summary function
summary(jtbd)
[/sourcecode]
<strong>Result in the console:</strong>
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resultinconsole-t8dbkw.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-910"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resultinconsole-t8dbkw.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of results in console"" width=""515"" height=""339""></a>
Well...that is jolly helpful information!
<h4>Now for the plot part:</h4>
[sourcecode language=""plain""]
#the plot mapping - telling where your data to map on the axis
ggplot(jtbd, aes(x=Importance, y=Satisfaction))+
# the ""+"" allows you to add another function, each function goes on its own layer,
#so the order is important for example geom_point defines your data as points on the plot
geom_point(color=""blue"", alpha=0.5, size=4)+
# To map aesthetics in a more intentional way - for instance adding labels,
# we can use another function geom label which requires two variables
#(in this case Importance and Satisfaction)
# and tell it which column to get the labels from, in this case, the ""Job"" column
geom_label(aes(label = jtbd$Job), nudge_y = 0.08, nudge_x = 0.06, hjust=""right"", alpha=0.8, size=4)
[/sourcecode]
This gives a starter plot like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/star_R-244yio2.png""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-914 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/star_R-244yio2.png"" alt=""Image of starter plot"" width=""800"" height=""429""></a>
Just to prove that it is easy to get started I gave myself a little challenge...
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NJY0dQdV-7I?rel=0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0""></iframe>
After that it is really all about the aesthetics with this particular plot. Specifically I added a data.frame (a container for data) for each aesthetic element such as text, lines, shaded polygons and areas. These were then called as shown below...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]
#Labels for the areas of the plot
labelover &lt;- data.frame(
x = 1,
y = 9.5,
label=""OVERSERVED""
)
#Potential for disruption line
segment4 &lt;- data.frame(
x = 0,
y = 2,
xend = 7,
yend = 10

<h4>Step 5: Aesthetics</h4>
Well that provides an overview of the basics the rest will be based on your own aesthetic decisions. So I have provided the full code work-up with annotation below and recommend that you have a go and explore. Also if any of you are R and ggplot2 'pros' I am open to feedback as I am sure that it could be improved.
To summarise, from my perspective using RStudio has provided the following benefits:
<ul>
 	<li>A fast way to create reproducible visualisations of JTBD data</li>
 	<li>An effective way to create prototype data visualisations for a range of design contexts</li>
 	<li>An inexpensive option when compared to other data packages. Although I can get a student discount on software at the moment, I was thinking about the long term and developing a skill with an open source package</li>
 	<li>It has helped me to think differently about data and to iterate visualisations in the same way that I would with other design projects</li>
 	<li>It is immensely satisfying</li>
</ul>

919,1,17/05/2020 16:56,17/05/2020 16:56,"<h2>Why am I here (as in you, at this blog, and reading this now)?</h2>
I hope you are here because you would like an introduction to using RStudio for data visualisation. I also hope that you are here because you are interested in <a href=""https://strategyn.com/customer-centered-innovation-map/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jobs-To-Be-Done</a> (abbrev~ JTBD; Ulwick, 2016). This blog provides an example of how to apply one of the approaches that sits under the mantle of JTBD, an Opportunity Landscape (Ulwick, 2016; VIII. Target Hidden Growth Opportunities section).
<h3>What are we going to do?</h3>
We are going to create a plot, or Opportunity Landscape (SEE also Ulwick, 2017), based on data from a quick opinion survey that was distributed via social media. Survey respondents were asked to rate particular tasks that they regularly complete on a smart watch according to importance and satisfaction on 5-part <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Likert scales</a>.
At this point I should add a caveat, for those familiar with JTBD. These questions were not based on full <em>job</em> statements or stories but were abbreviated task statements. This is largely because based on survey testing, I found that the time it took to read and consider longer Job stories, based on Situation-&gt;Motivation-&gt;Expected Outcome (Klement, 2016) required too much mental effort for a &lt;15min survey. I have found Job stories to be indispensable at the interview stage, when derived from transcripts as a means to uncover motivations. In the context of this post I would say that my methodology is a bit of a mash-up of JTBD and Gerry McGovern's top tasks (2010; 2017).
<h3>Why are creating a plot?</h3>
I believe that the true purpose of any plot is to start conversations. Data visualisations have the power to both subvert truth and to challenge commonly held assumptions, I aim for the latter. Always.
<h3>Why are we using RStudio with ggplot2?</h3>
The beauty of using RStudio with ggplot2 is...well beauty. Most people can make standard Excel visualisations without too much effort, but even with a lot of tweaking they still have a heady whiff. In the past I used Adobe Illustrator, but speaking of my own failings it was too easy to leave the land of accuracy and enter the land of surface-treatment.
Here are my top reasons why you should consider using RStudio with ggplot2:
<ul>
 	<li>You know how to use Microsoft Excel, but would like to create better visualisations...</li>
 	<li>You have lots of data and you would like to segment it and look at a smaller portions without getting caught in a scrolling cycle-of-doom in a humongous spreadsheet...</li>
 	<li>You want something inexpensive - the only cost here is time, but it is well worth it...</li>
 	<li>Once you have built it, it can be used over and over and over...and tweaked quickly for whatever the need...</li>
 	<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> RStudio and gpplot2 can be used to prototype data visualisations for interface design and depending on your audience a realistic looking representation/visualisation could be very important.</li>
</ul>
If any of the statements above have piqued your interest then keep reading.
<h4>Step 1: Collect the Data, Show me the Data</h4>
In true Blue Peter style, here is one I made earlier...

[caption id=""attachment_884"" align=""alignnone"" width=""700""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JTBD_demo_image-1rd4pz7.png""><img class=""wp-image-884"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JTBD_demo_image-1rd4pz7.png"" alt=""Image of an Opportunity Landscape plot"" width=""700"" height=""560"" /></a> The plot above is based on Webcredible's fantastic blog post on the topic of JTBD <em>(Josephy, 2016).</em>[/caption]

I should add that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">your</span> plots can be much more extravagant than this, but essentially this is the basic type of plot that we are going to create to get started. The descriptive lines above are superfluous*. They are useful to keep commented-out in your code though as they can be used to create quick descriptive visuals for stakeholders when needed.
What we can read from the visualisation above is that I could have asked about a lot more <em>jobs</em>; it is a bit sparse, but 12 jobs is what this particular survey could accommodate. Also the majority of the jobs fall into the 'overserved' domain. This means satisfaction has been rated higher than importance and according to Ulwick (2016) this is prime territory for disruption. So although initially, when I looked at this visualisation I was like ""oh blast"", as I was looking for some untapped potential related to smart watch jobs and there is none. Actually it is more that customers are overserved for jobs that aren't perceived as that important and therefore the landscape is primed for some new competitor to come in and do the job in a cheaper and perhaps less good, but cheaper way, which though market adoption and iteration of 'said' cheap version may eventually lead to something better (Ulwick, 2016). Of course another dimension would be to ask questions about jobs that have not yet been considered for smart watch, but these were out of scope for this particular survey. In a way this plot perfectly sums up smart watches as they are still finding their footing, they are still superfluous to the smartphone which is almost ubiquitous.
The point I am getting to here is that this plot asks questions of the data, that we might not normally ask if we were looking at each question in isolation. It is only when we bring these jobs together that we reach a new level of meaning.
*Edward Tufte (2001) would likely frown to see these lines - ""erase non-data-ink"" (p. 105).
<h4>Collect the data</h4>
You will need a survey question something like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_display-w6adj4.jpg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-885"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_display-w6adj4.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of survey question"" width=""700"" height=""401"" /></a>
...Or split it into two versions of the same question depending on the allowances of your survey tool.

<blockquote>Q: Hey didn't you say earlier that you need a 5 part Likert scale? But you only have four options in the 'satisfaction' scale above?</blockquote>
The answer is I had to take a difficult decision about the experience of users on smartphones using my survey. One more column and it was over the precipice into the land of non-function. As I am only interested in 'Quite Important' and 'Very Important' and 'Satisfied' and 'Highly Satisfied' in this context I sacrificed the final column.
So the results for the first question looked like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_result-qp4oul.jpg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-887"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_result-qp4oul.jpg"" alt=""Image of results"" width=""700"" height=""533"" /></a>
For the Satisfaction element, I created an <a href=""https://support.office.com/en-us/article/IFS-function-36329a26-37b2-467c-972b-4a39bd951d45"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">IFS Function</a> in my final spreadsheet, to make 4 equaled 5, 3 equaled 4, 2 equaled 3 and 1 equaled 2. This put everything on the same scale.
<h4>Download the data</h4>
Any good survey tool should allow you to download the results to CSV format (Comma Separated Values) and any survey tool worth its salt should also provide a SPSS or data analysis format which codes each response with a number. So in my case I wanted to the most positive response to have the highest rank value. I am going to use Excel to sort the data, as that is/was my comfort zone and I think that it is good to start from a position of confidence and trust in the original figures prior to visualising them. Personally speaking after only a few months of working with RStudio, I now feel happy to complete the entire workflow in RStudio.
<h4>Tip: Split up your Importance (IMP) and Satisfaction (SAT) onto separate tabs in your Excel spreadsheet</h4>
Believe me this will make your life SO much easier, when it comes to doing your calculations.
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sort-the-data.001-1jk68l1.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-888 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sort-the-data.001-1jk68l1.jpeg"" alt=""Image of sort data slide"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /></a>
<h4>Step 2: Do the Maths</h4>
Having separated your data, create a new tab in your spreadsheet and create the rows defined in the column labelled <strong>A</strong> below. Then use the data on your Importance tab to populate column <strong>B. </strong>Start with one question-worth of data, we'll get to the rest of your questions soon.
<ul>
 	<li>So for row 3 ""total importance"": count all the entries in the importance column for that particular job from the first data row to the last - indicated by A<em>x</em> [COUNTA].</li>
 	<li>For row 4 we want to count how many of these entries had a rating of 4 (Quite Important) and 5 (Very Important). So we use a COUNTIF formula to look at values greater than 3. As we aren't dealing with decimals (yet), ""&gt;3"" is accurate enough for this purpose.</li>
 	<li>For row 5 we need to find out what percentage of overall responses are <em>Quite</em> and <em>Very Important</em>. So we divide row 4 by row 3 and then times by 10.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Create identical rows for satisfaction</strong> (after in my case, adjusting it upwards first, due to having a satisfaction scale of 4 parts), so that you end up with this...
<h4>The Opportunity Algorithm</h4>
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/presentation.001-28jxl4y.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-891 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/presentation.001-28jxl4y.jpeg"" alt=""Image of the opportunity algorithm"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /></a>
So you will need a final row, row 10 to calculate the <strong>Opportunity Score</strong>. This is outlined above, but to explain the contents of the image. You take the outcome of importance, which is your percentage, so 9.6 in this case and take away the outcome of satisfaction, again a percentage. So that would leave you with -0.1, then add back on the outcome percentage which is is 9.6 and you end up with the total opportunity score of 9.5.
outcome importance +
(outcome importance - outcome satisfaction)
= Opportunity Score
9.6 + (9.6 - 9.7) = 9.5
This is not the most exciting opportunity score, the most exciting ones are more than 10, or better yet more than 12.
Oh and here is why I said that you should start with the formulae for one question-worth of data and to split Importance and Satisfaction onto separate sheets...Once you have created one column for Importance and Satisfaction data you can simply drag the formulae across all of your questions.

<h4>Create R Food</h4>
Having done all that you need to get your data into columns for RStudio, specifically we want four columns to start off with: Job; Importance; Satisfaction; Opportunity; and Score.
So that it looks like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/becalculated.001-1mbcuiy.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-892 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/becalculated.001-1mbcuiy.jpeg"" alt=""Image showing the columns in the spreadsheet"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /></a>
Tip to get your data from rows to these columns use the transpose(array) function in Excel, here it is in action...
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sCdz2fOSWAI?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
<h4>Step 3: Get Sta(R)ted</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Install R from the R Archive:
</strong>Pick a mirror close-by (geographically speaking), e.g in UK - <a href=""https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">University of Bristol</a>, <a href=""https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Imperial College London</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Mac tip:</strong> make sure that you check the MD5 hash and SHA hash match. You can do this quickly and easily in terminal.<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHdrIlHS2-4?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></li>
 	<li><strong>[Mac only</strong><strong>] </strong><a href=""https://www.xquartz.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">XQuartz</a> Install - information about this is provided at R Archive above.</li>
 	<li><strong>Install RStudio:</strong> again do check the MD5. You can get the installer here - <a href=""https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 4: OoooH aRrrrr</h4>
Launch RStudio and have a go!

[caption id=""attachment_909"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1164""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/RStudio-console-u9gkdl.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-909"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/RStudio-console-u9gkdl.jpg"" alt=""Image of the RStudio UI"" width=""1164"" height=""851"" /></a> Image of the RStudio UI[/caption]

So now that you have done all of the preparation you can actually start to create plots. Before you do anything else you need to load your library. In this case we are using ggplot2 which is part of <a href=""https://www.tidyverse.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hadley Wickham's (and others) Tidyverse</a> - packages for R with standardised concepts and grammar. This is a good place to start as I have found that some of the R packages are quite idiosyncratic and it can take a bit of time to wrap your head around the internal logic, whereas the Tidyverse stuff all made a lot of sense. This could be because I originally learned to code in the JavaScript iteration of <a href=""https://processing.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Processing.</a>
RStudio comes with a lot of packages already, so...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]library(gpplot2)[/sourcecode]
If you needed to install it first and say you wanted the whole Tidyverse it would intuitively be...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]install.packages(tidyverse)[/sourcecode]
Next you need to define your data and as you will recall we set that us as a .csv file on the desktop so lets call the data 'jtdb'...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]
library(gpplot2)
jtbd &lt;- read.csv(""~/Desktop/JTBD_R/jtbd.csv"", header = T)
#This is a comment in RMarkup, so lets also find out about the data itself by using the summary function
summary(jtbd)
[/sourcecode]
<strong>Result in the console:</strong>
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resultinconsole-t8dbkw.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-910"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resultinconsole-t8dbkw.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of results in console"" width=""515"" height=""339"" /></a>
Well...that is jolly helpful information!
<h4>Now for the plot part:</h4>
[sourcecode language=""plain""]
#the plot mapping - telling where your data to map on the axis
ggplot(jtbd, aes(x=Importance, y=Satisfaction))+
# the ""+"" allows you to add another function, each function goes on its own layer,
#so the order is important for example geom_point defines your data as points on the plot
geom_point(color=""blue"", alpha=0.5, size=4)+
# To map aesthetics in a more intentional way - for instance adding labels,
# we can use another function geom label which requires two variables
#(in this case Importance and Satisfaction)
# and tell it which column to get the labels from, in this case, the ""Job"" column
geom_label(aes(label = jtbd$Job), nudge_y = 0.08, nudge_x = 0.06, hjust=""right"", alpha=0.8, size=4)
[/sourcecode]
This gives a starter plot like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/star_R-244yio2.png""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-914 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/star_R-244yio2.png"" alt=""Image of starter plot"" width=""800"" height=""429"" /></a>
Just to prove that it is easy to get started I gave myself a little challenge...
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NJY0dQdV-7I?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
After that it is really all about the aesthetics with this particular plot. Specifically I added a data.frame (a container for data) for each aesthetic element such as text, lines, shaded polygons and areas. These were then called as shown below...
[sourcecode language=""plain""]
#Labels for the areas of the plot
labelover &lt;- data.frame(
x = 1,
y = 9.5,
label=""OVERSERVED""
)
#Potential for disruption line
segment4 &lt;- data.frame(
x = 0,
y = 2,
xend = 7,
yend = 10
)
#further down in the code where the plot is created - I call these#
ggplot(jtbd, aes(x=Importance, y=Satisfaction)) +
#Calling the text
geom_text(data = labelover, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size=5) +
#Calling the 'potential for disruption line' and adding some annotation to it
geom_segment(data = segment4, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend), alpha=0.2, linetype=2) +
annotate(""text"", x = 5.1, y = 9, label = ""Potential for disruption"")
[/sourcecode]
<h4>Step 5: Aesthetics</h4>
Well that provides an overview of the basics the rest will be based on your own aesthetic decisions. So I have provided the full code work-up with annotation below and recommend that you have a go and explore. Also if any of you are R and ggplot2 'pros' I am open to feedback as I am sure that it could be improved.
To summarise, from my perspective using RStudio has provided the following benefits:
<ul>
 	<li>A fast way to create reproducible visualisations of JTBD data</li>
 	<li>An effective way to create prototype data visualisations for a range of design contexts</li>
 	<li>An inexpensive option when compared to other data packages. Although I can get a student discount on software at the moment, I was thinking about the long term and developing a skill with an open source package</li>
 	<li>It has helped me to think differently about data and to iterate visualisations in the same way that I would with other design projects</li>
 	<li>It is immensely satisfying</li>
</ul>

<ol>
 	<li><strong>I developed and added the patient story.</strong> This was based on a characteristics list which I worked through rather vigorously on the afternoon of the 25th. This is still in handwritten form, so I will link to it as a google doc later on. I have included some key references for that process below. I want to highlight the National Joint Registry (2016) data, which was particularly helpful during the process of defining the patient story. Also the specific images that I used will be cited on the portfolio site (including cc0 works; royalty-free works) as I feel it is always very important to include the provenance of images in any context, but especially when engaging in a thought process based on a fictional patient/nurse interaction.</li>
 	<li><strong>I added images to support the patient story. </strong>These images were sourced from pixabay and one of my all-time faves, Creative Commons search as a means to filter Flickr images by license (<a href=""http://search.creativecommons.org/"">search.creativecommons.org</a>).</li>
 	<li><strong>I recreated the images that I found for the patient story as drawings in Adobe Illustrator.</strong> I wanted the images in the timeline to be small (100px x 100px); this is a limited amount of 'bandwidth' to communicate a visual concept. For this reason I decided to use Adobe Illustrator to trace the images and then re-paint them, so that I could accentuate certain aspects through the use of selective colour. This worked well and I did investigate whether these images could be included as svgs, but the visual information was too complex as they were based on photographic materials. As a result I stuck with .png format as the final output.

 	<li><strong>All of the images were optimised using <a href=""https://kraken.io/"">Kracken.io</a>. </strong>Honestly, I absolutely love this tool and will be using this from now on for all my images. Their algorithm somehow trims off the excess while keeping the core visual information.</li>
 	<li><strong>Accessibility. </strong>I ran an accessibility analysis on the site using the WAVE Web Accessibility Tool (<a href=""http://wave.webaim.org/"">http://wave.webaim.org/</a>). It is pretty good, I still have a few aria, alt and title tags to include here or there but I have made progress in this area.</li>
 	<li><strong>Infuriating. </strong>As someone who uses Reader View (I found out that this is the official name for it) mode in Firefox and the equivalent in Safari, I was very frustrated by the restrictive and arbitrary local style sheet implemented by this mode. I have spent way too much time customising how the site looks in this context, but it really mattered to me as this would really put me off a site. Also, focusing on it has highlighted the importance of the semantic web; the <em>reader </em>mode taps into the &lt;sections&gt; and other html5 element definitions. With a bit of hardcore tweaking, I finally have something that I can stand behind. The tweaking is outlined in <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/08/lots-of-changes-to-this-version-of-the-css/"">this development post</a>, however I found out by digging into the <em>reader</em> displays in the respective browser stylesheets that they will ignore certain css classes. Specifically I needed to implement a class called .hidden which is the container for the flickity carousel dots. The 'dots' are completely useless in the <em>reader</em> view and just look like an orphaned ordered list. I also instituted a .sr-only class which is applied to loading GIFs and other elements which should not be shown in the <em>reader </em>mode. All of this digging will serve me well for the print stylesheet, no doubt...</li>
 	<li><strong>I ran the Google mobile accessibility test on the site - It passed! </strong>Here is the proof: <a href=""https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly?id=W8x9QG2vBB-_NxSwy4fVLQ"">https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly?id=W8x9QG2vBB-_NxSwy4fVLQ</a>
There is still a lot of content to add, but it is great to know that I am on the right track.</li>

There are of course areas that I would have liked to do more with but I have kept them on my <a href=""https://trello.com/b/4a20fYpf/web-development-portfolio-project"">Trello board</a> for future reference as the portfolio site particularly will live on.

<h2>Goals for this journal</h2>
<em>""The posts in this journal will follow two reflective threads as I work through the module. The first thread is the development of this journal site, based on an independent install of the WordPress Content Management System or CMS (2016). I will outline my thinking behind decisions that I have take related to customisation and in particular accessibility and mobile responsiveness. These are the two key areas that I would like to learn more about during the module."" </em>-Yes, I believe that I have done this.<em>
</em>
<em>""...The second thread is related to the creation of my portfolio website. This part of the coursework will be coded from scratch and needs to rich in features, structurally sound and accessible.""
</em>- Yes, I have done this although it has been a very long road.
<em>""It is important to me that this journal’s theme is as accessible as possible,....""</em> - Tried my best on this, although I would have liked to do more with the visited links and some of the buttons.
<em> ""...based on the WordPress theme templates available. At some point down the line I may even create a child-theme in order to customise it to the necessary level. For this reason I need to spend a bit of time checking the coding integrity of some of the themes that I have installed to ensure that they are suitable for customisation.""
</em>- I did this and this site is proudly running a child theme.
<em>""...I have installed a list of themes filtered for accessibility features. Please bear with me, as in these early days, it is likely that this site might change it’s skin a couple of times while I decide on a suitable theme. I will also conduct some more thorough investigations using a local copy of WordPress and themes in MAMP (appsolute GmbH, 2016).""
- </em>I did this and also created a connection to my GitHub profile via Cybersyn plugin and setting up a RSS from my Atom feed.
I also provided options for user customisation through the use of the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/31/development-prototypes/"">stylesheet switcher</a> and the accessibility plugin.
<h3>Goals for the portfolio site</h3>
<h3>Original Concept with annotation (areas achieved are highlighted in <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">blue</span>)</h3>
The project’s working title is <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic.</em> It is a website structured around a <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">central page</span>, which l<span style=""color: #3366ff;"">eads the viewer through a fictional narrative of a patient’s experience of anxiety while awaiting a medical operation or procedure</span>. In the narrative the <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">patient will be using an electronic wearable device to track their own vital signs and also for logging their anxiety levels</span> – the <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">influence of this countermeasure will be explored</span>. The narrative is represented through a <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">navigable timeline enriched with the use of graphical, written and statistical information</span>. The underlying project, to use wearable devices to measure patient pre-operative anxiety is attributed to and courtesy of Dr. Theofanis Fotis (School of Health Sciences, University of Brighton), whom I am collaborating with at this time.
<strong>Scope</strong>
The <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will:
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">deliver an approachable overview of a research project</span> – the proposed research project is to design a user interface for a medical wearable device to measure anxiety;</li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">explain the issues that can result from pre-operative stress in patients</span>;</li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">provide a point of entry for those with little or no knowledge of the subject</span> as well as explain the potential benefits of the project to experienced medical professionals.</li>
</ul>
The <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will not:
<ul>
 	<li>provide in-depth medical information;</li>
 	<li>provide any fully formed solutions or recommendations for implementation of wearable devices in a medical setting;</li>
 	<li>provide advice or suggestions for the production of patient care plans. As a narrative scenario it is exploring a hypothetical scenario in which a wearable device is used.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Benefits</strong>
The <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will provide the following benefits:
<ul>
 	<li>it will provide a valuable resource for explaining the research project to potential funders and future stakeholders; - <em>Hopefully in the future</em></li>
 	<li>it will help to raise awareness of the potential issues related to patient pre-operative anxiety; <em>- Hopefully if it finds a wider audience</em></li>
 	<li>it will <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">highlight potential ways that increased knowledge of a patient’s vital signs and self-reported anxiety could improve patient care</span>;</li>
 	<li>it will provide an <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">accompanying contextual information for the proposed future interface design project</span>; <em>- I have shifted my thinking it is more of a service design project.</em></li>
 	<li>it will be a publicity tool, that can be used to explain the project within the academic and medical online communities. <em>- Hopefully, again if it finds a wider audience.</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Goals</strong>
The following goals are related to the successful creation of the <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic:</em>
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">provide a valuable portfolio piece</span>, not only in terms of web development, but also as a tool for the research team and collaborators;</li>
 	<li>contribute to the approval and ethics approval of this as a concept for F.MacNeill’s final graduating project; <em>- Hopefully, I am about to start writing this.</em></li>
 	<li>stimulate dialogue around the issues and ideas raised by the <em>p</em><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic; - Hmmm, this may have been a bit ambitious </em></li>
 	<li>encourage potential funders and stakeholders to invest in the project. <em>- Hopefully...</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Objectives</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Create an <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">accurate portrayal</span> of a possible patient care scenario.</li>
 	<li>Provide <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">information highlighting the benefits</span> of the proposed project.</li>
 	<li>Pose the project concept as an open question in order to gauge feedback and interest from the medical community and potential funders and/or stakeholders.</li>
 	<li>The user audiences for this are diverse but have one thing in common, they have very limited time to engage with a website of this kind. This website should take no longer than <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">10-15mins to navigate</span>, the equivalent of a typical coffee/tea break. <em>- I have hopefully achieved this</em></li>
 	<li>To be shared via social media between interested parties. <em>- Did not get an opportunity to integrate any sharing tools.</em></li>
 	<li>To be <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">adaptive and easily viewed and navigated on mobile devices</span>.</li>
 	<li>To be <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">accessible to those on older web browsers (as far as possible)</span>.</li>
 	<li>To be <span style=""color: #3366ff;"">accessible to users with disabilities</span>, allowing for personal customisation (as far as possible). <em>- The customisation wasn't really possible in the end.</em></li>
</ul>
To summarise, I believe that I succeeded in my goals to learn about web development, accessibility and to gain domain knowledge about the perioperative environment in preparation for my future project.

<h3>Here is a quick list of the final finishing touches that I made to my site.</h3>
<strong>Revisiting the post about my last meeting with the stakeholder</strong> - <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/12/final-meeting-with-stakeholder/"">""I add some data to support this section""</a>
I added a google charts treemap to support the care section (Google, 2016). Using this as a way to show the comparative percentages between each of the different reasons. I wrote tooltips for the treemap to help with the navigation of the data I had to use html codes to make it work.
<strong>I added columns to the reference section </strong>(Coyier, 2010). However, I also found that the reference section was too long and ended up moving the section to a new page for those viewing from mobile devices. When I develop the site further, I will probably always keep a link to a separate page as NHS trusts frequently block pages which link to external websites. I might be able to get a university domain cleared for their whitelist though.
<strong>I added the icons for the goals</strong>. These were obtained from the Noun project and are cited on my new <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/key-resources/"">Resource page</a> which links up a lot of the artefacts which I have created as I have gone along.
<strong>I passed the mobile test and the validator tests</strong>. Although, the Nu Html Checker (validator.w3.org) took the opportunity to yell at me about the aria tags/elements: <a href=""https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fitsuite.it.brighton.ac.uk%2Ffjm19%2Fwearable%2F"">https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fitsuite.it.brighton.ac.uk%2Ffjm19%2Fwearable%2F</a>I tweaked them a bit, but decided to leave them as I had added them based on the results that I was getting from the screenreader.
Mobile test: https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly?id=4uQnwXr_vs07ixrqbFArEA
<strong>The print stylesheet was very tricky</strong>. I ended up having to omit the timeline in the end as there was no way to format it in context. I found some really good articles via Smashing Magazine in the process of getting it sorted though.
<strong>Media queries for tablet devices.</strong> I found some really helpful media queries on CSS-Tricks for this. Although the screen resolution in the queries was no longer compliant, so I had to remove that. This was important as I wanted to omit the tooltip and the keyboard navigation in from being seen on tablets. Based on experience iPads and Google Nexus (Nexi?) are the most used devices amongst the academic audience for the site.
<strong>Refresh button for data visualisations.
</strong>I found an onclick command (Lobito, 2015) for refreshing the web browser and I added this as a button. What had annoyed me was that everytime you resized the browser, the visualisations did resize, but they didn't update. This allows the user to refresh their view of the data.
<strong>Minify used to minimise CSS and JavaScript for the final production site files.</strong>
<strong>I realised that I did have a lot of content sections rather than articles.
</strong>I had misunderstood some aspects of the structure and realised that I needed to revisit the guidelines on this.

1009,1,17/05/2020 17:48,17/05/2020 17:48,"Gary Finnegan from Turnitin - he prioritises new features for the Blackboard plugins
They have moved to an Agile, Scrum development and project management frameworks.
They are taking apart the plugins at the moment and rebuilding, in order to make
<strong>Key issues</strong>
<strong>Basic</strong>
Account migration (self-managed hosting)
Email non-submitters feature wasn't working - now fixed since the slide was created
Reminder of the change to the URL post-Jisc so that means upgrade is necessary.
<strong>NEXT</strong>
Basic ---> NEXT will be installed over the top
Direct ---> there will be a way to migrate to NEXT but it will be harder
Basic to Direct ----> best to stay with what you have got as they will not be a way to migrate the data between the two. Support will continue for plugins until everyone is migrated to NEXT.
<strong>Blackboard versions</strong>
<strong>Supported:</strong>
Learn 9.1 Self hosted (SP14 April and October)
Learn 9.1 Managed Hosted (SP14 April and October)
</strong>Working to support:</strong>
Ultra, tricky due to lack of building blocks, however they are currently working Blackboard.
Turnitin Next will have multiple marker function. Once they build multiple instructors into the core product then multiple instructions will be better in the iPad app. Group submission support will also be part of Tii Next. These are early release features. It doesn't sound like anonymous marking for groups will be supported though.
The support on the plugins will not end, this contradicts the Tii website. They are working on resolving this issue on their website and making sure that the information represents reality.

Tentative road map
<strong>Audience questions:</strong>
The issues with the Office365 online file type submissions should be resolved now as Microsoft have altered the way that they make .docx files (after originally causing the issues by changing the way that they made docx files). The download and then upload is the best option, they are looking at cloud submit options (hard to implement technically).
Rubric sharing will also be easier in Next!
Moving towards LTI, they are working with Blackboard to extend the functionality marking sure that the marks go back to the grade Centre (not always consistent at the moment).
The plugin will also get BETA accounts for the plugin - this will be sent to account admins.
They are changing their release policy so, there will be more frequent release. The roadmap looks a little bit abrupt, but there will be overlap and any migration will be phased and coordinated for quite periods. They are working on communication. Will Murray will talk about it more in his presentation.

The underlying technology is over 10 years old and this has presented challenges for change. It is a heritage pre-cloud solution with cloud demands. They built their own file system, this was amazing back then, not so great now.
Rapid change has been hindered by this - however they are still effective.

Stats show that the implementation of Turnitin leads to a reduction in plagiarism
<strong>LESSONS LEARNED</strong>
last year they were aquifer by Insight Venture Partners - see it as a best in class system, but has some underlying technology that needs an update. So they have put in a lot of investment. They have brought in new Executive Leadership: Marc Daubach - Corporate VP (formerly Exlibris), Bobby Wilson CFO, Ron Park CTO specialises in highly available knowledge and emergency notifications. He has spearheaded the move to Agile Scrum. Elijah Mayfield, leading researcher in machine learning (VP New Technologies). Will is the only one to remain in the executive.
Steph Butler is their director of User Experience, they have never had a UX lead before. Her specialism is ethnographic research with instructors, they are in the process of building out their UX team. They are implementing the minimum requirements derived from the ethnographic research.
Jess Wells, Principal Product Manager - Integrations - she is working on the LTI move. Everyone is moving towards the cloud.
They would like to have much less of other people's code to manage!
What all of us want is for their code on their cloud servers, not code that has to be schlepped to Blackboard and implemented. This is the long-range plan. This should make testing easier.
Holder Beuger - Director of Customer Service - he is taking all control of all the product support
New Technology - Turnitin have acquired Netherlands plagiarism detection company Ephorus - they bought those developers in
They also bought Moss (Measure of Software Similarity) - this does plagiarism detection in software engineering. They have the software now and have a project planned to look at integrating into Turnitin in January. Will ship it initially as standalone solution for those who want to use it on the command line.
Another acquisition - LightSide from Pittsburgh, USA.
Machine learning technology. LightSide have managed to create positive marking feedback which is automated. You can go in and edit the text unlike other automatic rubric marking solutions.
<strong>Significant Reorganisation</strong>
They have kept the Ephorus office in Utrecht.
New office in Melbourne
Single web team and the are looking to address the communication issues, as no longer the responsibility of individual country-based offices.
Product focus - Product team expansion, move to Product Ownership, focus on user experience.
Access: Reliability

They are developing a new crawler - deeper crawl (they are going to crawl JavaScript to to look at PDFs hidden behind script), UK and US dbs.
<strong>Answers</strong>
Better triage and better routing for user tickets.
They have implemented new telephony system, they want to provide better self-service help for students.
To do: Human Responses they are looking to build solutions into the product, so that responses/solutions are available in the interface rather than having it in the
Customer Satisfaction survey now in place, after support terms.
Expanded Success by 22%
Customer Success Roles
Tier-2 Support Roles
Product change - fixing password resets, so that a ticket isn't required.
<strong>Answers</strong>
Self service - Jules Sunderland
YES - working on customised downloadable manuals!
This is being implemented at: guides.turnitin.com
Help desk revamp
<strong>EULA & SLA project</strong>
They are working on providing the option for universities to agree a EULA and update student agreements locally, rather than the individual students having to accept the EULA. They are working on the legal requirements for this.
Hoping to embed help tickets into Blackboard and Moodle and have better way of gathering system information. They will require a new building block.
<strong>Additions</strong>
Questions: they want calls to come to the institution rather than going to Turnitin. They want a call logging system. Need insight into the kind of calls which are logged.
Integrations students will NOT have access to the self-service. The help desk will redirect integrations students back to local help desks.
Will - from a staff perspective it will be helpful to raise the ticket from within the new plugin and auto-generate the system information needed by Tii support.
They will allow these features to turned on and off.
Transition to Scrum - they were locked into a waterfall process before with Waterfall you end up spending months writing the specifications, by which time they are out of date.
They are now working on two-week iterations.
- they are at the point with the iPad team, blackboard team and Moodle team. The backend stuff and some other teams who are transitioning.
60 engineers have been trained in Scrum certification.
12 product owners trained
New UX team

Machine marking is the future, they will evaluate the marking of say 500 essay marking and then create an engine to automatically mark papers. If the marking is not consistent for the engine to pick up then they will use a company to mark the papers with moderation and second blind. FM: is anyone else worried by this?

Video presentation from Elijah Mayfield
Talking about changes to revision assistant
LightSide labs out of CarnegieMellon
Focusing on students improving as writers. As students are working on their essay they can receive feedback on their essay, this feedback does not compete with the instructors feedback.
The technology looks beyond word count, grammar and spelling. Looking at content analysis, high level goals related to assessment criteria.
Version control, each time a student requests feedback a snapshot of a draft is taken.
Instructors can review all the drafts, thus they can choose to mark all of the versions.
Piloted this spring in the US
14-15 year old students drafted their papers on average 11 times, an increase over the normal teacher-student model.
High school students drafted 8 times.
They have seen an improvement in the papers according to criteria between drafts.
They are not going to evaluate creativity writing.
They would like volunteer institutions in the UK to be early adopters so that they can gear to the product. For each writing prompt --> they need to gather hundreds papers - so data mining.
Questions about revision assistant
Very controversial, but Will assures that it is not to replace instructor feedback it is to allow drafts which are rated according to criteria. Drafts aren't currently supported so it is adding functionality.

Evaluation viewer - is mainly a face lift so they think onboarding is sufficient. The assignment manager will be far more drastic, they will send tutorial videos.
Brief or the ability to exclude sections - this is a features request
Grading other media types - at this point they are not going to add support for other media types. Spec move and audio.
User voice system - Domi makes the point that the features voting is limited as features sit in the queue for years...Will: hopefully with agile
Tii use word to render documents, so if can be seen in Word then it should be rendered in Tii. Can hyperlinks be made active? It is an image not a PDF they would have to overlay the hyperlink over the picture.
Multiple files or multiple drafts - are what they are working on.
Student ID integration is on the roadmap.
Fiona question: Are you going to handle the EU Safe Habour Ruling more adequately by providing EU data centres? - following EU guidelines.

1015,1,17/05/2020 20:23,17/05/2020 20:23,"Part 1 of my final evaluation.
This entry outlines key decisions that I made regarding accessibility towards the end of the development period. I am writing and publishing it retroactively as it as represents a very large amount of thinking and work, which I kept notes about as I went along.
<!--more-->
<h3>Based on observation</h3>
Based on looking at a large number of NHS and governmental sites, referenced in former posts I realise that accessibility is crucial, perhaps even more than your average portfolio site. For example, looking at NHS England (2017) site I see that they offer a text-to-speech service. Based on experience in my day-job working with software vendors, some of these solutions can be quite expensive. It was however important to me to make the site as accessible as possible and that has meant some sacrifices along the way.
<h3>Keystone texts</h3>
While engaging in this in-depth investigation into the accessibility, I found myself referring to the following keystone texts.
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles"">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) Roles Model (n.d.)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/"">The Paciello group's blog</a> - UX accessibility specialists an amazing resource</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility"">Mozilla Developer Network Accessibility Guides</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/"">The Nielsen Norman Group blog</a> - a frequent go-to of mine</li>
</ul>
I feel like I have only scratched the surface with the WAI-ARIA roles, but based on testing I feel that the site is accessible as I could get it within the allotted time. In the end I found a blog post on the subject by a rather brilliant developer, Aaron Krauss (2016) who did a great job of how to practically use certain ARIA labels and roles. What I did find is that there is quite a lot of redundancy in the code, but you need to have it there as the screenreader doesn't necessarily pick up the semantics in the page construction as you might intend.
Here is a video of my screenreader testing in action with tab key only - tabindex (Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)
<div style=""position: relative; padding-bottom: 56%; padding-top: 20px; height: 0;""><iframe style=""position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"" src=""https://mediastream.brighton.ac.uk/player?autostart=n&amp;fullscreen=y&amp;width=0&amp;height=0&amp;videoId=6936&amp;quality=hd&amp;captions=n&amp;chapterId=0"" width=""300"" height=""150"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe></div>
<h3>What the font?</h3>
I conducted some reading (Nielsen, 2002; Martin, 2009; Franz, 2014; ) around legible fonts and font sizes and optimal line height. I have tried my best to work with the best practices, although that does get tricky with the mobile screen size. However, the attention that I have paid to optimising the CSS stylesheet for plain readers should help those who use accessibility features on mobile devices.
<strong>Added a fix to the superscript</strong>
I found a very helpful snippet for fixing line height for superscript (used for references) and subscript. Thank you to the -ever helpful- CSS Tricks site (Coyier, 2009a).
<strong>Contrast</strong>
As much as I loved the white headers along the timeline the contrast was not sufficient. The colour scheme is themed around blues and purples and unfortunately white on blue doesn't comply with WCAG 2.0 unless the blue shade is very dark or the white font is very large (Snook, 2015; WAVE, n.d.).
<h3>The accordion had to go</h3>
Upon testing the tab-key only navigation I realised that there was no accessible way (that I could muster anyway) to navigate the accordion (Mary Lou, 2012) and for that reason it had to go. I added two simple tables, which I was trying to avoid, but as they area features comparisons this use us permissible. I was not using the tables for layout, but for the display of information in a standardised way. After the fact I found this accordion example at codepen.io which might have been better, but not without a lot of work: <a href=""https://codepen.io/stowball/pen/eZKwRv"">https://codepen.io/stowball/pen/eZKwRv</a>
<h3>Sprite fun</h3>
I got my sprite on and added sprites for the device images. The device images were drawings that I created in Adobe Illustrator based on photographs. All the photos were <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en"">CC0 - public domain</a> apart from the image of jeans, which I have listed below. This was added as an image through the CSS and aria-labelled for descriptive purposes.

<h3>Fixing the tab svg</h3>
I replaced the svg tab to be a proper thing rather than the Frankenstein's monster-like CSS creation <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2017/01/07/charty-mccharterson/"">I outlined in an earlier journal entry</a>. Once again I referred to the excellent CSS-Tricks (Coyier, 2013) and Mozilla Developer Network resources (2016c), as well as the Implementing Responsive Design book from the reading list (Kadlec, 2012).
<h3>Asking myself questions</h3>
I tried my best to standardise all the units in the CSS although if I were to do it all again with hindsight I think that I might design my grid to work with ems or rems (once they are widely compatible or older browsers fall out of use). I'm sure that I have missed things in spite of several thorough read-throughs. It all validated okay.
<strong>CSS code block structure:</strong>
e.g. div class or id - this resembles the layout of a div
.div {
display: block;
position: relative;
width: 90%
height: 60%
color: #000;
margin: 2% auto 2% auto
padding: 2% 4%; (shortenings used where possible)
}
e.g. typography class or id - this resembles the layout
h2 {
font-family: ""Helvetica Neue"", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
text-align: center;
font-size: 1.5em;
line-height: 1.25;
font-weight: 300;
}
In the HTML where white-space pre-line formatting was needed for the Goals and the references sections, I included comments to help indicate why the formatting was different in the markup.
Also regarding the CSS as I was going through it, to weed it a bit, I asked myself a series of questions to help determine which units to use and such. I have included these below.
<ol>
 	<li>Is it text? = ems</li>
 	<li>If it moves it is em or %. If it doesn't or cannot move it is pixels</li>
 	<li>Is it in a column in the grid - then margins and padding are percentages (unless there is a very good reason for them not to be)</li>
 	<li>Is it in the grid - then margins and padding are percentages</li>
 	<li>Is it used in the html? No, then get rid of it
Could it be consolidated in any way? Does it share the same values as another class and/or id?&lt;fn&gt;I would have liked to do more on this, but I ran out of time. Did my best to do it as I went along.&lt;/fn&gt;</li>
 	<li>Does it need to be a negative value (particularly in the media queries)? Then it is in ems.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Rationale:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>When it is something that needs to have set dimensions such as a button, I am using pixels.</li>
 	<li>For text I am using ems to ensure compatibility with older browsers</li>
 	<li>For table related items and blocks which reside in divs I have used percentages.</li>
 	<li>Used hexadecimal shortenings when it made sense to do so and it did not change the hue of the colour (three digits rather than the standard 6). I prefer digits rather than word descriptions, due to colour precision.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Media queries</h3>
Did a lot of work on these, again I found the Implementing Responsive Design (Kadlec, 2012) and the Introducing HTML 5 (Lawson &amp; Sharp, 2011) books particularly helpful.
I also added a arrow keys image and tooltip to help explain the navigation of the timeline. You will notice for the tabbed navigation of the site in the screen reader demo that the timeline is skipped over initially and I added to the JavaScript in order to allow the tab key for navigation in addition to the arrow keys. The arrow keys allow for greater freedom though, as once you have started tabbing through the carousel/timeline, you cannot get out of it with another tab press. Thus leaving it to the end and this is something for me to raise with the original developers to see if they can address that in future versions of the widget.

</span></blockquote>
So up until the 24th of December I dallied with solutions for the navigation, but I had not really tackled the core issue. It was truly the elephant in the room, as so much of the mobile responsiveness that I hoped for my site hinged on the navigation working smoothly. I spent quite a bit of time looking around the web for inspiration, usually finding elaborate JQuery scripted examples; much as I found with the search for sliders/carousels. I really wanted to build it myself and resolved to create with CSS and JavaScript.
<!--more-->
The bulk of my inspiration ended up coming from the NHS Choices website's navigation (<a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx"">http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx</a>). It isn't responsive, but the styling of it says serious and health, so I thought what if I make a really responsive nav/menu based on a similar layout?
I also really didn't want to create a hamburger menu (the three lined menu icon used on many mobile/responsive sites). Personally I think that these are overused and when I observe folks try to use them in day job, they often lead to frustration. This is particularly the case for those people who do not use the Internet on their phones/tablet that often (they might have a few favourite apps though) or those who are new to having a smart device. It was reassuring to find that I am not the only one who feels this way about the <em>burger</em> (<a href=""https://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/"">Abreu, 2014</a>; <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/"">Pernice &amp; Budiu, 2016</a>). So I decided to go with a simple button labelled menu which expands or contracts based on the media queries.
To make this look nice I put in a bit of CSS animation smoothing for the transitions. Although I took inspiration from other folks coding (references are below and in the markup) the navigation is original. I decided that my button would trigger the header to become bigger or smaller based on an Active class in the CSS. I also had to figure out how to make the button toggle the active class (drew inspiration from this example for that: <a href=""http://codepen.io/razitazi/pen/WbZaOq"">http://codepen.io/razitazi/pen/WbZaOq</a> &lt;fn&gt;I must add that I did not add the class effect to the &lt;body&gt; and they did. I added it to the elements, I tried both but working with the individual elements worked better for my menu.&lt;/fn&gt;.
I also had to the solve the problem of the someone opening the menu and leaving it open and then resizing the page in a responsive web browser. This would just make the site look a bit broken. This was fixed in the end with a media query, although I did try scripting a solution with an eventlistener looking for the window resizing, this added to the processing burden as it would fire too many times. I also tried restricting it by setting it to look at the status of the menu, but the media query with transitions in the CSS was more elegant and worked in major browsers on Mac and PC (Firefox 31+, Chrome, Safari, IE9).
A couple of days later I made a return-to-top button, creating a new piece of script that used the smoothScroll function (mentioned in earlier posts). This allows folks viewing the site on a desktop or tablet to quickly return to the top of the page. This was inspired by a button on one of the <a href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearningteam/"">wordpress themes that I use in my work</a>, &lt;fn&gt;The button on this site (<a href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearningteam/"">http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearningteam/</a>) appears once you are halfway down the page. I didn't feel the need for quite as much animation so I kept my button a bit simpler.&lt;/fn&gt; I always liked it and wanted to create my own. I decided to alter and reuse the same svg, as the Flickity navigation button arrows. It is nicely minimalist arrow and is also design consistent (and I should add so much better than the arrow that I designed - below). Also I checked whether the svg code could be <a href=""http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-optimiser"">optimised further</a> and it was already as good as it could get.
<code> var anchor = document.querySelector( '#top' );
var topBtn = document.querySelector('.return-top-button');
var options = { speed: 700, easing: 'easeOutCubic' };</code>
<code>topBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
smoothScroll.animateScroll( anchor, topBtn, options );
}, false );</code>

I added a <em>skip to content</em> link as part of my development of the core navigation in the site. This is assist those who use screen readers of navigate via keyboard. I was prompted to do this based on my previous experience with accessibility requirements and based on advice in the <em>Inclusive Design Patterns </em>book (Pickering, 2016).
<!--more-->
This was not as simple to accomplish as you might think and the resulting function behaves differently in each browser, however regardless the ""skip"" option is part of the tab-index as should enhance the navigation of the site.
Here is how it works in Chrome - not aesthetically pleasing, but satisfies the requirement. The video shows what happens when the user visits the page and presses the tab key, this reveals the skip to content button.

<h3>Adding polling aka <em>feature creep</em> 16/12 - 24/12</h3>
In my <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/12/content-research/"">last post</a> I mentioned that I had decided to add a poll as I felt that some further interaction might be needed. I now realise that really a bit of a superfluous feature and upon reflection I have spent too much time on it.
<!--more-->
What I can take from it, is that I learned a lot about JSON and PHP in the process. This activity was really the textbook definition of feature creep or scope creep&lt;fn&gt;A handy definition from wikipedia just in case you need it: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep</a>&lt;/fn&gt;.
Here is a consolidated account of what I did and what I found out in the process.
I thought about using the fantastic Google charts tools. I could not, however figure out how to feed data into the chart, based on clicks of the options and then also how to store that information. Here is an image of a mock-up that I made during that particular phase.
[caption id=""attachment_265"" align=""alignnone"" width=""840""]<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/24/on-the-importance-of-self-discipline/screen-shot-2016-12-16-at-15-11-41/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-265""><img class=""size-large wp-image-265"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-16-at-15.11.41-1024x559.png"" alt=""Screenshot of site showing the chart in situ"" width=""840"" height=""459"" /></a> Initially, prior to the radio buttons, I was just using buttons to visualise the poll options. It looks nifty, alas it had no functionality whatsoever.[/caption]
Then I thought about creating a custom Google form skin as the front-end for a Google chart. There was some documentation on this (<a href=""https://github.com/heaversm/google-custom-form"">https://github.com/heaversm/google-custom-form</a>) and I referred to the excellent documentation from Google as well, but it wasn't the right thing.
Then as I use <a href=""https://www.polleverywhere.com/"">PollEverywhere</a>, a web application for polling, in my day-job I thought that using <a href=""https://api.polleverywhere.com/"">their API</a> might be a good way to go. Especially as their poll visualisation is very nice. I must highlight at this point that I wanted to avoid using an iFrame and have a solution that was integrated with the site. This is largely due to the fact that the iFrame content would almost certainly be blocked on NHS Trust computers (again this knowledge is based on my professional experience). The PollEverywhere API highlighted the use of JSON (Javascript Object Notation) for the configuration of polls. However, I have to admit that their documentation was a little beyond my own knowledge and I felt unsure of where to start.
I asked Marcus for his advice on the 16th of December and I also found a <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_poll.asp"">PHP AJAX poll tutorial on the W3Schools</a>. Normally I'm not a huge fan of the w3schools tutorials, but this seemed like the perfect solution.
I was able to build the poll, but the issue with it is that it is that it stored its values in a standard text file and this is a very insecure method. Marcus advised that I look at writing the values to a JSON file via the PHP and then pulling said values through html for the poll visualisation.
<iframe src=""https://mediastream.brighton.ac.uk/player?autostart=n&amp;fullscreen=y&amp;width=320&amp;height=260&amp;videoId=6325&amp;quality=hi&amp;captions=n&amp;chapterId=0"" width=""330"" height=""270"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe>
So I decided to see if I could adapt the script to read from and write to a JSON file instead. Easier said than done as the syntax from PHP to JSON confused me a bit. Marcus did a bit of troubleshooting on it too and this was very helpful to get on the right track. I finally decided that it was time to join StackOverflow and start asking and answering questions, here is the question that I asked: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41301335/json-newbie-permanently-saving-values-to-json-between-browser-reloads"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41301335/json-newbie-permanently-saving-values-to-json-between-browser-reloads</a> . The community were great and I got a lot closer to a solution. However, echoing data back via html in the php file proved too tricky and issue to surmount. I could get the one option to display, but I couldn't pull the previous results to display. This was immensely frustrating, to be so close and yet missing at the final hurdle.
[caption id=""attachment_267"" align=""alignnone"" width=""499""]<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/24/on-the-importance-of-self-discipline/2016-12-24_10-30-29/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-267""><img class=""size-full wp-image-267"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-12-24_10-30-29.gif"" alt=""Animated GIF showing the issue with the display of data pulled from the JSON file"" width=""499"" height=""349"" /></a> Animated GIF showing the issue where I could only display current data not pull the existing data from the JSON. The values update in the JSON but the html based on echoing the PHP does not.[/caption]
It was also really hard to debug the issues as a small change could take a few re-runs (despite hard reload and clear-cache reloads) to actually manifest and break it all.
Then I stopped and thought, why am I doing this? Sure, it looks pretty and adds an element of interest, but after working on <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1An9w8tBnoofrjyhXPfFiRBzAAvbo7uEQCgRG97lRJtU/pub"">the user characteristics list</a>, it hit home that I had been the victim of my own self-inflicted feature creep. The end users have very limited time to look at this site and probably wouldn't have time to contemplate the poll question. Furthermore, the poll question detracts from the content of the site. Finally it introduces additional security considerations and affects the life-span of the code in the site. So I have decided to archive what I did offline and continue from where I left off on the 16th. You live and you learn.
I shall now be focusing on an prioritised to-do list and I will deviate from my Trello board no longer.
<h3 id=""skipinfo"">Added a skip to content link for accessibility</h3>
Something that I have had on my list for a while was to add a skip to content link for screen readers and keyboard navigation users. I looked at how a few sites did it and settled on advice from the WebAIM site (<a href=""http://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/"">http://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/</a>). Although instead of positioning the content off-screen by 1000px I positioned it above with top:-20em. Although the WebAIM site recommends against positioning above due to the fact that this may cause a scroll off-screen, based on testing I have not found this to be the case and as Mozilla use this method (e.g. here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/50#document-main) and I am trying to convert all my units to dynamic values (ems or percentages) - it seemed like the way to go.

Thankfully my decision to create a child theme has served me well as the updates were harmonious with my existing customisations. I don't think that I will be adding more plugins at this point, but I will go through my posts and ensure that the header hierachy is correct for accessibility reasons. I will also go through my posts and make sure that links open in the current window instead of a new tab, as this was flagged in both my accessibility book (pickering, 2016) and in Nielsen's <em>Top 10 mistakes in web design</em> article (2011). Also I will go through and review my heading levels as this was a persistant flag in the WCAG 2.0 inspections and it is easy to get it wrong &lt;fn&gt;e.g. h4 before h3 for some kind of aesthetic reason - I'm sure that I have done this somewhere without realising.&lt;/fn&gt;

<h3>Topic research</h3>
I have been engaging in quite a bit of topic-based research related to the content of the site. Most specifically the publication, <em>Making IT work: Harnessing the power of health information technology to improve care in England</em> (Wachter, 2016). This report highlights the need to empower patients to share their data with apps and wearables and also the need for interoperability. Interestingly upon a second reading it is almost like the health equivalent of the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy, which I have observed and supported through my day job (MacNeill, 2015). I will use this information in tandem with a statistical report which Dr. Fotis provided related to hip replacements (National Joint Registry, 2016) and broad reading in the perioperative subject area (see reference list in my next post) to create a story for the patient.
The good news is that Dr. Fotis likes the site so far, so I am on the right path.
<h3>Adding interactivity</h3>
In addition to the contact form that is mentioned in the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKRrdMlqlhcmzfVjdAwMEo5nUzuIYRhEgPgtR9giCgM/pub"">task scenarios</a> I wanted to add an easy way of visitors to add feedback. I thought that a poll might be a nice way of doing this. I investigated a few ways of doing this, but essentially I wanted to provide two options for visitors to choose from using radio buttons. Then store the values and display the results after the user had selected their option/choice. This turned out to be no easy task and I will compile all of my references related to this in the next post. As I writing parts of this post retrospectively I can say that I was working on parts of this poll, on and off, for the better part of two weeks.

<h3>Flickity carousel</h3>
I decided to make the <em>carousel-cell</em> 100% width due to the need for a more immersive timeline. What I mean by this is that I felt that the cells were too modular before and the greater width (formerly 66%) makes more sense in terms of showing the long anxiety levels .svg file.
I still have lot of work to do in terms of consolidating my JavaScript and CSS files into one of each and then also minimising my JavaScript file. One of the things that Marcus brought to my attention was that my script sources should not be loaded in the header of my index.html and that this was bad practice. They now reside under the footer, but this presented some new challenges. For example the smoothScroll function had issues loading so I added a new main.js file (this is will become the final master js file) and added a window EventListener and then added an init function - to initialise SmoothScroll after the load is completed.
The other issue is that Flickity Carousel for the timeline started to flash up momentarily as a column until it found it's <em>brain</em> (aka the script actually loaded). I actually only discovered this due to using my mobile broadband stick in a cafe and noticed the latency. The Flickity Carousel is currently initialized at the bottom of a unique flickity.js file&lt;fn&gt;I needed to keep the smoothScroll.js and flickity.js separated while I figured out how to get things working harmoniously.&lt;/fn&gt;. What I needed to do to solve this was to set the carousel opacity as 0 until the window has loaded and as the carousel is not a function in the same way as smoothScroll it was a bit trickier for me; there wasn't something straightforward for me to work with. What I ended up doing was adding a new variable for carousel immediately after initialising flickity (entails designating the css selector as a flickity carousel) and then applying a style to make the opacity 1&lt;fn&gt;I had to consult github for help with this as I was at a loss for a bit: <a href=""https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/269"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/269</a>.&lt;/fn&gt;. This is working nicely, however the delay or a white screen may be improved by a momentary loading GIF in order to explain what is going on for a slower connection - one to add to the to do list! I quite like the Buffer GIF animation and this helpful tutorial explains how to code something like this with an SVG file as opposed to GIF, I'll give it a go: <a href=""https://cssanimation.rocks/buffer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://cssanimation.rocks/buffer/</a>. Also due to the audience of this site, I think that it is important to include the word ""Loading"" alongside any GIF or animated SVG.
As part of the process above I added the cellSelector option to the carousel in JSON format, as initially I thought that I might want an EventListener. It seems that this might be useful later on, so I have left it in place for now.
e.g.
<code>data-flickity='{ ""cellSelector"": "".carousel-cell"", ""freeScroll"": true}'</code>
Another issue was with the customised Flickity dots (used for timeline navigation) was that I had set the position of their container to <em>absolute</em> and the overflow to <em>hidden</em> as a solution for smaller screens or browser windows (the dots disappear entirely on a mobile phone sized screen). However, I noticed a sort of ghosting issue as a consequence of the overflow.
[caption id=""attachment_245"" align=""alignnone"" width=""471""]<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/11/cellular-concerns/ghostydots/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-245""><img class=""wp-image-245 size-full"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ghostydots.png"" alt=""Screenshot of the dots with the ghosting overflow issue"" width=""471"" height=""154"" /></a> It is quite subtle, but can you see those little grey lines between 2 and 3 and also between 3 and 4? There be the ghosties![/caption]
I fixed this by adding ""white-space: nowrap;"" to the dots themselves so that the wrapping was disabled.
<strong>Result!</strong>

<h3>Here be the stuff of nightmares...</h3>
I have to admit that I spent way too much time on this issue, but it was honestly driving me to distraction.
So having fixed my grid so that it was had even widths and looked lovely as I started to use my grids I found that I needed to add unique classes for the blocks that appear in each &lt;section&gt; of the html file. The grid structure is left in place as a logical point of reference.
Then I found that my written content in the grid was overflowing beyond the height of the sections. This was relatively easy to fix by setting the classes for the sections to have relative positions and have overflow set to auto. Phew.
However, as I added some placeholder content to my grid blocks I found that the widths were still perfect but the heights of columns were not okay. What I mean by ""not okay"" is that if a block had more written content then it was longer to contain this content. Therefore blocks positioned adjacent to each other looked askew.
<code>
/* tried this and hated it
.is-table-row {
display: table;
}
.is-table-row [class*=""col-""] {
float: none;
display: table-cell;
vertical-align: top;
border: solid 7px #EEEEEE;
border-radius: 0;
}
*/
</code>
This was strangely very hard to fix. I tried several methods. First I tried fool it into thinking it was a table, but I lost my gutter and I worried about responsive accessibility. I also tried CSS pseudo classes (which I now have a little bit of experience with after customising the dots), but it didn't provide the desired look either. I also tried adding attributes to the section container and the ""One True Layout Method"" (Coyier, 2010) where the margin-bottom is set to -99999px and the padding-bottom is set to 99999px and the overflow is hidden. This feels like brushing the problem under the carpet and it looks like it too as it cut off the bottom of my block outline and I like the outline. In the end I used row class for my grid defined to display <em>flex</em> and and then use the flex-wrap <em>wrap</em> setting. Alas, with one fell swoop my dream of full functionality in Internet Explorer is dashed as Flexible Box Layout module is not supported in IE9 at all (<a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=flex"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://caniuse.com/#search=flex</a>).
<h3>SmoothScroll and the Navigation</h3>
In an <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/04/moving-things-along/"">earlier journal entry</a> I had cited this fixed navigation example on codepen (<a href=""http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QGQPmX"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QGQPmX</a>) as being close to what I would like for the navigation on my site, however I have also been devouring a book on web accessibility, <em>Inclusive Design Patterns Coding Accessibility Into Web Design</em> and anything fixed in the CSS was identified as a no-no in the book (Pickering, 2016). I had also found that the fixed header height meant was causing issues with the distance of the smoothScroll function. I was able to fix this by checking their documentation and adding the labeling the header as <em>data-scroll-header</em> and then specifying this in the initiation script. Previously I had defined a spacer div for this purpose, it didn't work perfectly for the smoothScroll function, but it ended up being handy for defining white space between the timeline and the about area (in addition to the use of margin settings it was helpful to have something that was independent). In the end I didn't need most of this work as due to the advice in Pickering's book, I decided that the navigation header needed to have a relative position instead of being fixed.
<h3>Anxiety levels</h3>
As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, I wanted to give the carousel/timeline a long image that continued along the base of cells showing the anxiety levels of the fictional patient during the story (this was shown in <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/11/20/wireframes-2/"">wireframe version 3</a>). I started by testing with a .png image and as I anticipated it looked awful but I was most interested in getting the positioning setup correctly. The issue was that the image kept showing up above or in front of the text inside the description div. Also as the window was resized the image floated upward from its initial position. The only way that I could fix this was to use z-index and a fixed position for the image container (I already broke the rules about <em>fixed</em> items - see above) and then added a unique style id called #anxiety to specify how my image was shown in the container (as a background image). Initially I thought that I might need to specify one strip of the image per cell in the Flickity, but they kept overlapping and having layering issues. The logical approach in the end is to have one very long SVG. I need to optimise the SVG prior to the final release of the site, but at the moment I am still adding to it in Adobe Illustrator as I need to finish writing the patient story prior to finalising the graphic. As this graphic only serves an aesthetic purpose I think it is alright that it is both fixed and defined as a background image (and therefore cannot have an alt tag applied for accessibility reasons).
<h3>Bios section</h3>
I added box-shading to the photos - they needed a little something to differentiate them against the background. Once again this is not supported in IE9 although it is less critical than the flex-box issue outlined above.
<h3>Responsive adjustments</h3>
I worked on the mobile phone break point for the media queries first. Specifically, <code> @media (max-width: 414px)
</code>
I based this size on the Google Nexus 6P and the Apple iPhone 6 plus as although these are both phablet sized I certainly need the grid blocks to be shown in a single column at this size not in rows. In general I would like to steer clear of too many device specific breakpoints as it is better to think about the legibility of the design rather than get too obsessed this (an article by Justin Avery (2013) supports this view: <a href=""https://responsivedesign.is/articles/why-you-dont-need-device-specific-breakpoints"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://responsivedesign.is/articles/why-you-dont-need-device-specific-breakpoints</a> - not everyone agrees on this). Also, I realise that I need to go through the code and consolidate my classes and ensure that my units are standardised as % and <em>em</em> prior to doing too much work on this. So the rest of the styling and layout needs to be completed first, based on a desktop first mentality.
<h3>Thinking about the patient</h3>
I found myself rethinking the fictional patient's name, based on the ever helpful Wolfram Alpha. It seems that women named <em>Ruth </em>are demographically older than the fictional patient should be (roughly 55-65yrs although I need more data on this - more on this in my next post). Although Wolfram Alpha is based on demographic information from the United States it is a good basic litmus test for this. Here is my comparison, <em>Carol </em>may be a better name: <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=name+ruth+compared+to+carol"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=name+ruth+compared+to+carol</a>

<h3>I am feeling griddy</h3>
Now that my grid is in situ, I am able to base layout elements on  it. I do think that in most cases I will need to make unique versions of the columns and tweak the row layout, but keeping the grid architecture in place and temporarily adding the rows/columns to the html has been really helpful for planning out the sections (as shown in the screenshot below). I used my grid to start planning the layout of the content on the Flickity carousel cells - as it turns out this took quite a bit of work (more on that in my next post). I also had my first go at creating an SVG, albeit a very simple one as a placeholder for the first cell in the carousel. The SVG shows the outline of a head and I made it in Adobe Illustrator, this will need to be replaced by more of a photographic image for needs of the project.
<h3>about-About</h3>
Adding in an <em>About</em> section as the timeline really jumps right into talking about the fictional <em>Patient</em>. I will need to update the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQNj8SiUKWqBOTRTo5rnLcG8NxToeAJ7B9Q1eWWRDdl-_Z-dCbCG-E8xzjOhSWc86TWtNntOcL7K84F/pub"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">task list</a> to reflect this, but it remains within the bounds of the tasks as task scenario 1 included, ""<span class=""c0"">Read introductory information"", this needs to become task scenario 2 and the others need to be bumped up. I also need to revise things where they are <em>areas </em>as opposed to pages, it is bit too specific at the moment.</span>
<h3>Testing in Internet Explorer 9</h3>
I was astounded to find that pretty much everything on the site is working as one would expect in Internet Explorer 9. This is fantastic and vindicates some of the script selections that I have made in terms of browser support. I was very concerned that the z-index settings would not be respected, but thus far it is looking good. Safari is still a problem though...

<h3>Toying with the notion of animation</h3>
One of the sites that I have mentioned before, <a href=""https://gamificationplus.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">gamification+</a> has some pretty gorgeous and playful animations on it. I took a look through the code and the javascript attributes and most of it is managed via CSS. This is good, although I would am concerned about browser support and also performance rendering. As a consequence I probably won't add these features. As a pre-check I used the Chrome timeline tool to record the processes on an older computer that I have at home and I felt that the impact on performance would be a problem &lt;fn&gt;the new features operate at the limits of what I want, timing-wise so I will need to see if I can optimise them further. I have already removed aspects of the code that is not used.&lt;/fn&gt;.

1026,1,17/05/2020 20:23,17/05/2020 20:23,"This week's journal entry is short and sweet as I know what I need to do but I need to crack on and actually do it! My goal for this work-weekend is to try and get all of my <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">bits together in order to present a semblance of a whole</a>.
Things that I have fixed/done this week...
<!--more-->
<ol>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>The irritating arrow scroll issue</strong> when using keyboard keys to navigate the Flickity image carousel (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-label"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">aria-labelled accessibility controls</a>). Solution: I created a new version of the flickity.js and found the section pertaining specifically to the accessibility controls (keycode == 39 and event.preventDefault&lt;fn&gt;Marcus gave me a hint for this one, but I needed to give the code a thorough mental and literal work through to ensure that I was putting it in the correct place.&lt;/fn&gt;).</li>
 	<li><strong>Looked at the grid widths again</strong>, I think that these are approaching completion. It will still be a big job to implement the grid on my new portfolio page.</li>
 	<li><strong>Started to sort out media queries</strong>. Initially, I had thought that mobile first would be best, but considering the work domain of my primary user audience (nurses) it needs to operate optimally for desktop and be adjusted for mobile. My grid design will help to make this possible.</li>
 	<li><strong>Navigation</strong> - I created a prototype version of the navigation. I am not particularly happy with it as it is reliant on browser respect of the z-index property in CSS. Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer 9 are respecting the layering, Safari is not. The navigation has been given a fixed position so that is floats down the page with the user. The navigation links take the user to different sections of the page&lt;fn&gt;sections are literally HTML 5 sections, this will require a bit of fix-up code for browsers that do not support that, e.g. <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines#Using_HTML5_elements_in_non-HTML5_browsers"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines#Using_HTML5_elements_in_non-HTML5_browsers</a>&lt;/fn&gt;. I like the styling of <a href=""http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QGQPmX"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this navigation example on codepen</a> and might see if I am do something more like this as my current navigation feels a bit retro (complete with a:active and a:hover).</li>
 	<li><strong>For the navigation transitions</strong> I initially looked at whether I could reuse my work on the vanilla js smooth-scroll function. I did some reworking for the scrolling to work in the vertical, rather than horizontal but it proved unwieldy and did not work at all in Internet Explorer. After looking at a few options, almost all of them reliant on JQuery (as is the case with the navigation example above). I settled on <a href=""https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">C. Ferdinandi's Smooth-Scroll script on github</a> as it is based on vanilla.js and <em>span id</em> which searches for a specified tag id. Something based on tag id as opposed to specified regions seems more durable as the regions will constantly change based on the responsive layout. I did encounter some issues with exactly where the <em>span id</em> should be placed in relation to the sections. I'm sure that this is something that I can resolve by taking a closer look at the documentation.</li>

It has been a busy week as I was preparing to give a talk on one of my earlier UX design projects where I looked at how a user's trust could be gained (or lost) through aspects of interface design. I am associated with the <a href=""http://www.sense-brighton.eu"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SenSe Research Cluster</a> and it was a fantastic honour to be asked to talk about my project (especially as I am a humble MSc student).

1028,1,17/05/2020 20:23,17/05/2020 20:23,"After a lot of consideration, struggle and annoyance I finally gave in and decided to use a pre-existing tool for the timeline section of my front page. I looked a few different contenders in this final pass. Essentially, I came to the realisation that I would not be able to learn the requisite Javascript in order to build something sophisticated enough from scratch. I did a bit of trying out in this jsFiddle project, but kept running into deadends (this project is in a partially built state - so please do not judge me - the javascript is largely erased by this point): <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/43gg6x3v/7/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://jsfiddle.net/43gg6x3v/7/</a>
<!--more-->
Initially I found only jQuery examples - but as I have previously stated, I really wanted to work with Vanilla Javascript, due to load times, future proofing the code content. I also feel that it will be more beneficial to my learning to stick to learning Vanilla Javascript (or rather Ecmascript 6) so that I truly <em>get</em> the language prior to becoming too invested in specific frameworks.
Also having looked at these two resources: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/liamcurry/2597326"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">jQuery vs. Javascript gist</a> and then the From <a href=""https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/from-jquery-to-javascript-a-reference--net-23703"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">jQuery to Javascript: A Reference</a> - vanilla makes much more sense to me.
<ol>
 	<li>jQuery example 1: horizontal timeline (<a href=""https://codyhouse.co/gem/horizontal-timeline/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Article</a> | <a href=""https://codyhouse.co/demo/horizontal-timeline/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Demo</a>)</li>
 	<li>jQuery example 2: vertical timeline (<a href=""https://codyhouse.co/gem/vertical-timeline/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Article</a> | <a href=""https://codyhouse.co/demo/vertical-timeline/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Demo</a>)</li>
</ol>
After looking at these and searching quite a bit, I came across a tool called lory (<a href=""http://meandmax.github.io/lory/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://meandmax.github.io/lory/</a>). It is essentially a code package or widget for creating interactive slideshows or gallery. I thought that there might be some milleage in creating a slideshow or gallery and somehow customising it as a timeline. After testing I found that lory also was overly complex for my needs.
Then I came across a really helpful article about a widget tool called <a href=""http://flickity.metafizzy.co/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Flickity</a> on css-tricks.com (<a href=""https://css-tricks.com/creating-responsive-touch-friendly-carousels-with-flickity/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://css-tricks.com/creating-responsive-touch-friendly-carousels-with-flickity/</a>). It was love at first sight! Here is an example on codepen showing how the Flickity slideshow originally looked: <a href=""http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/bNLGNZ"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/bNLGNZ</a> - Flickity is both responsive and touch optimised and had a vanilla option in addition to jQuery. It seemed like a good solution.
Before my modifications:

After my modifications:
<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/11/25/timeline-tool-identified/flickityedit/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-214""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-214"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/flickityedit.png"" alt=""Screenshot showing the edited version of the Flickity carousel"" width=""952"" height=""414"" /></a>
Main modifications were:
- the timeline-line- size of slides
- outlines for references
- big dots on the timeline (need to figure out how to label these)
- overflow to ensure that the content doesn't wrap strangely on a mobile device.
There is still a lot to do and I need to fix an issue when the keyboard keys, when used for navigation make the web page scroll-right in a strange way. I also need to unite this with the other parts of the page that I have started to build.
Finally, Flickity is a paid solution unless it is used under a <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GPLv3 license</a>. I am passionate about open source and was already licensing my work under an <a href=""https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MIT license</a> so I have decided to set the rest of my project to <a href=""http://flickity.metafizzy.co/license.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">comply with the GPLv3 license</a>. This means that the license information needs to be included in the header of each source file. As the portfolio site will not contain any original research and will only provide an overview of the project this will also comply with the University's Intellectual Property rules&lt;fn&gt;As a student and employee I need to be aware of the university's Intellectual Property rules, which are available here: <a href=""https://staff.brighton.ac.uk/ease/ip/Pages/IP-Information.aspx"">https://staff.brighton.ac.uk/ease/ip/Pages/IP-Information.aspx</a> . However as portfolio site will not provide software with potential for commercial value and the project information itself is in the early stages it complies with the rules.&lt;/fn&gt;. Also in the markup of the html, CSS and Javascript I have indicated where pieces of code have come from and if/when licenses apply.
<strong>Update:</strong>
Shortly after writing this post I solved the issues outlined above (see: ""There is still a lot to do..."") and these discoveries are outlined in the next couple of posts. I realise that I forgot to mention how I solved the issue of the number labels on the dots below the Flickity carousel. This problem turned out to offer me a very valuable lesson in the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before"">pseudo element ""before::"" or ""before:""</a>. I have used the former, ""before::"" as this was introduced in CSS3 and is compatible with IE9 based on my testing.
I figured out that the dots themselves could be used as a counter-increment for the addition of the number labels.
<code>.dot {
position: relative;
overflow: hidden;
display: inline-block;
width: 40px;
height: 40px;
margin: 0 20px;
background: #a9a9a9;
border-radius: 50%;
cursor: pointer;
<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">counter-increment: flickity-page-dots;</span>
}</code>
<code>.dot::before {
display: block;
text-align: center;
<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">content: counter(flickity-page-dots);</span>
padding-top: 11px;
font-size: 20px;
color: #FFF;
}</code>
As the dots themselves are automatically produced by the Flickity Javascript, this meant that my number labels were now produced too. A nice solution.

1029,1,17/05/2020 20:23,17/05/2020 20:23,"After starting my initial experiments/prototypes for the portfolio project from a boilerplate I decided that I wanted to build my own responsive CSS grid from scratch.
<!--more-->
The grid turned out fairly well although there are some very slight issues with the column alignment which I need to sort out. I also still need to add the mobile device break points. I did find it very helpful to make use of the CSS calc() function to actively resize widths in percentages based on window size (calc()., 2016). This is a fantastic function although the support for it isn't universal yet (82.73 according to caniuse.com). Having said that I did try my grid in Safari to see how it behaved in an unsupported browser and I was pleased with how well it resized.

In this wireframe, I took ideas from wireframes 0 and 1, but removed the next buttons in favour of a timeline at the top of the page. The top section of the page, containing the timeline, is shown as overflow (beyond the width) of the page to indicate the dynamic content. Clicking on the <em>years</em>, and circles on the timeline is intended to swap out the slide content and information in the centre of the timeline section. The arrow buttons on the left and right were also intended to switch between the content slides. These buttons ideally would also be operable via arrow keys on the keyboard.

The new iteration of the design seemed cleaner and more focused in the sense that any page visitor would be immediately be shown the patient's story as an interactive narrative. However, this also meant that all my prior work on the smooth scrolling was for naught. I did try to see if I could tweak it to go from left-to-right or rather back and forth, but that was a futile effort.
A related attempt at this was to look at transition whether I could build the timeline itself in CSS by creating a &lt;div&gt; for the line itself and a &lt;div&gt; for the timeline circles but adding them as squares and then using the border-radius at 100% made them into circle. As you can see from the video below, this is ended in a vomit-inducing interface.

Further to this as I was influenced by the DuckDuck About page's interactive timeline (Titlow, 2014) I recreated it locally on mydevelopment computer. I then added it to my web space using the source files - stripping all that I could until it was only the timeline. However, I discovered that the coding and structure was not idea for this project. The code (CSS and Javascript particularly) had a lot of vague naming making it hard to follow and there was a LOT to strip out. So, the search for a solution continues, I think that I need to take a different approach to this problem...
<h3>Considering colour</h3>
Upon looking at a number of medical websites for journals, professional bodies and organisations including:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx"">NHS choices</a> (blue/orange/green)</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.nmc.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nursing and Midwifery Council</a> (dark blue, aquamarine, pink and lavender purple)</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.rcm.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Royal College of Midwives</a> (dark blue, two hues of light blue, white, purple and grey)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.nursingtimes.net/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nursing Times</a> (dark blue, aquamarine and white)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://journals.rcni.com/journal/ns"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nursing Standard</a> (scrubs green, two hues of dark blue, grey and orange for callouts)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/current"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Lancet</a> (purple, blue, green - a lot of white space)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.msf.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Médecins Sans Frontieres</a> (red and black&lt;fn&gt;An outlier with the red and black theme, however this would underline the critical nature of the work they do providing aid in emergency situations.&lt;/fn&gt;)</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.bmj.com/thebmj"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The British Medical Journal</a> (blue and white, orange callouts)</li>
</ul>
The colour schemes contain a lot of blue and this influenced me to look at some different colour combinations. I used the palletton colour selector web application (<a href=""http://paletton.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://paletton.com/</a>) to try a few bold colour combinations. I also tried it with some vision simulations (available on the bottom right) to see how the contrast behaved for different types of colour blindness. The swatches below show one of the better combinations I came up with, although it still needs work.
[caption id=""attachment_190"" align=""alignnone"" width=""400""]<a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/11/20/wireframes-2/01palettonswatches/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-190""><img class=""size-full wp-image-190"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/01palettonswatches.jpg"" alt=""Image showing a colour scheme created using paletton"" width=""400"" height=""80"" /></a> Paletton colour scheme 1[/caption]
The challenge with this medical site is that I feel I need to avoid a number of colours that may evoke negative associations. For example, hues of red might suggest blood and certain hues of yellow should be avoided due to the <em>hospital-yellow</em> association. The blues above seemed a bit dark, so I tried some lighter hues for Wireframe 2, paying attention to the contrast between the text colour and the background colour.

<!--more-->
A key update from our conversation was that the portfolio site should have a different name in order to be more appropriate the specific medical situation that it describes. The new title is:
<blockquote>Wearable Devices for Perioperative Anxiety
This is because our patient's journey spans all the way through to recovery</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Theo helped to define the audience for the site as the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Theatre Nurses who are members of the AFPP&lt;fn&gt;The Association for Perioperative Practice - a professional body supporting this area of medical practice: <a href=""http://www.afpp.org.uk/home"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.afpp.org.uk/home</a>&lt;/fn&gt;</li>
 	<li>Academic Staff both at the university, other Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and funding panels</li>
 	<li>General nurses who work on pre-assessment prior to operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Potential funding bodies:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.afpp.org.uk/home"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">AFPP - The Association for Perioperative Practice</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""http://www.nihr.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NIHR - National Institute for Health Research</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
In order for me to create a characteristics list, Theo put in a request for some basic demographic information from the AFPP. Also I can base some of the characteristics for academic staff on information available at the university. I will not present these artefacts via this blog but will provide some generalised information based on what I can deduce. The purpose of this venture is for me to complete basic UX research to help make sure that I am considering the needs of my target audiences. Completing a complete characteristics list and personae is outside of scope.
<h3>The Journey</h3>
My discussion with Theo really helped me to pin down aspects of the patient journey and how that could be presented within the site. He liked the presentation format of the DuckDuckGo timeline, so I definitely need to spend more time investigating how that was made, coding-wise (AND it works in IE).
<strong>Who is our patient?</strong> We discussed potential operations for the patient and decided that a hip replacement would be a good scenario. Making use of some demographic data for this type of procedure could help to ensure that our patient seems realistic. Our scenario is placed sometime in the near future, where prescribing a wearable device as part of treatment plan is perfectly normal.
<ol>
 	<li>GP referral to a consultant and the wearable device is prescribed.</li>
 	<li>Consultation with a specialist.</li>
 	<li>Outpatient pre-operative assessment clinic.</li>
 	<li>Letter for date of operation
<ol>
 	<li>Conditional circumstance: the operation needs to be rescheduled and the new date clashes with the patient's overseas trip and causes their anxiety levels</li>
 	<li>The operation ends up being two months after the original date</li>
 	<li>In the days leading up to the operation the patient experiences high levels of anxiety and as a result the operation is rescheduled to occur first in the day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Day of operation and recovery.</li>
 	<li>Recovery and return of the device.</li>
</ol>
I have revised the Task Scenarios to reflect the changes above: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQNj8SiUKWqBOTRTo5rnLcG8NxToeAJ7B9Q1eWWRDdl-_Z-dCbCG-E8xzjOhSWc86TWtNntOcL7K84F/pub"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQNj8SiUKWqBOTRTo5rnLcG8NxToeAJ7B9Q1eWWRDdl-_Z-dCbCG-E8xzjOhSWc86TWtNntOcL7K84F/pub</a>
<h4>Additional ideas and resources to investigate</h4>
I wondered about looking at data displays of blood pressure, heart rate and visualisations of anxiety levels to inform the design. Richard Griffiths mentioned some work in the school on the design of healthcare-specific interfaces, so I will ask him if he has any further information on that.
Theo also suggested that I check out the Medopad Chemotherapy app (<a href=""http://www.medopad.com/medopad_Ltd/Chemotherapy_app.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.medopad.com/medopad_Ltd/Chemotherapy_app.html</a>) - I have taken a look and it is impressive. I especially like the Apple Watch interface.
<h4>Supporting information for Characteristics lists</h4>
Theo was also to answer some questions for me aspects of the typical work environment of a nurse in terms of access to technology. This will also help to info the design.
My original text questions along with his answers are below.
<blockquote>Q: So would a theatre nurse have access to a computer at work? A: Yes
Q: Would our expectation be that they access our website on their work computer or a personal mobile device at work?
A: Both but rather at home due to limited available time at work.
Q: What web browsers do they typically have access to at work? Internet Explorer, what version have you seen in practice?
A: most common used are IE, Firefox and Chrome
Q: If the nurses were looking at the website at work, how much time could their realistically spend looking at it (e.g. is it something that they might look at during a coffee break – suggested 12mins maximum – 5mins to understand the goals of the site).
A: Following the above comment, in the case where they look at it at work, 12 mins maximum.</blockquote>",Meeting with stakeholder,,inherit,closed,closed,,773-revision-v1,,,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,,773,http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/uncategorized/773-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

<strong>Sharing what I have learned thus far from building my child theme</strong>
Mark Joste from the DMP PG programme invited me to join his project site <a href=""https://community.brighton.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">community.brighton.ac.uk</a>&lt;fn&gt;University of Brighton's Digital Award winning project&lt;/fn&gt; as part of an Accessibility special interest group. <em>Community</em> is based on WordPress, it felt like a good opportunity to share what I learned about the WP Accessibility plugin and the best settings for it's configuration. Mark is testing it out prior to deployment.
<strong>Have a project meeting on Wednesday
</strong>I have arranged a meeting with Dr. Fotis who has been away on a research trip. I plan to show him the designs and prototypes thus far and to iron out exactly what will need to go into the patient journey. I also need to find out more about the target audiences for the infographic/site as I don't know enough to come up with a basic set of characteristics (beyond what I have outlined already in the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nxisu8BaAGM3iaJ1r7oZv4b-XAM59ZMapdnNgK0rQzc/edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">task scenarios</a> and <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">concept</a>). I am also working on a higher fidelity prototype in Photoshop prior to meeting him. If time allows I may well make the prototype slightly more interactive in <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/experience-design.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adobe Experience Design</a> or <a href=""https://www.invisionapp.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">InVision</a> prior to our meeting. All of this feels like jumping ahead a bit, but this is necessary due to the structure of the project. As a general rule I learn by doing, so I have to set myself goals as I go along. You'll notice that I have dispensed with the paper prototype idea from the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>concept </em>journal entry</a>; I need to get further ahead than that so that I can actually 'build' a web-based project.
<strong>Wireframing</strong>
I did look at some wireframing tools, such as <a href=""https://balsamiq.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Balsamiq</a>, <a href=""https://wireframe.cc/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wireframe.cc</a>, <a href=""https://www.axure.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Axure</a>&lt;fn&gt;This one is definitely worth a more in-depth look over winter break in preparation for my final project.&lt;/fn&gt; and <a href=""https://www.mockflow.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MockFlow</a>. Once again though I found myself returning to my <a href=""https://rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_dotPad.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Rhodia dotpad</a>&lt;fn&gt;&lt;/fn&gt; and Adobe Photoshop for the wireframe and CSS grid planning. It just feels unencumbered and organised both visually and to an extent mathematically. <a href=""https://www.lucidchart.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Lucidchart</a> is certainly my tool of choice when it comes to UML diagrams, site maps, flow charts and task lists. Again, if I do decide to create a UML diagram&lt;fn&gt;Another to-do that I set for myself in the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">concept post.</a>&lt;/fn&gt;, I can only do so once I have a better idea of what information to include in the patient journey.
<strong>Coding
</strong>I have been trying out <a href=""https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WebStorm</a> alongside my old faithful <a href=""http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">TextWrangler</a> over the last few weeks as a complete solution for html, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I have to say I have been completely won over, especially since I hooked it up to my github repositories. It is actually a joy to use and alerts me to typing errors and possible syntax issues. I am delighted that it is available for free with a student email address.
<strong>Meetup
</strong>I attended the <a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Gamification-Meetup/events/234090387/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Brighton Gamification Meetup group on Wednesday</a> and was really inspired by some of the interface ideas that were discussed. Certainly worth bearing in mind in future, particularly The Manager's Path presented by<strong> </strong>Vasilis Gkogkidis (from Gamification+),<strong> </strong>which looks like a fantastic foray into self-tracking and self-betterment. I'll keep tabs on that as I consider the wearable app that I am looking to scope/design for my final degree project.
<strong>Development path this week
</strong>It seemed like the ideal time to move on from the ""firstedit1"" version of my prototype to a new branch, entitled ""portfolioprojv2"". I decided to use this new prototype as an excuse to update my CSS knowledge. Furthermore, after discussion with Marcus on Friday and testing on a PC this week, it seems that trying to make the site work in Internet Explorer is a no-go. I am finding that even with vanilla javascript, many simple features/functions that I want to add do not function at all in Internet Explorer 9. So what I will need to do is work on a more IE friendly version of the infographic in the future, but in terms of the assignment I need to focus on what will work in the majority of modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Edge). I will talk to Dr. Fotis about this as well, as undoubtedly some of these lovely British Medical Journal infographics don't work well in IE either: <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/infographics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.bmj.com/infographics</a> (thus my logical conclusion is that doctors might not view media-rich content at work in IE).
<strong>Navigation
</strong>I really think that the scrolling function, as discussed in previous posts is good. However, it was clear that the function needed to be refined. Alas, as outlined above the function doesn't work at all in Internet Explorer 9. I also felt that if I were navigating this site, I may run out of time at some point in the patient story and want to skip to another area of the site, so some sort of navigation always needs to be available. So I started to think about what might be possible. I drew some inspiration from the fix top-bar in the Gamification+ site (not shown in the mobile view of the site): <a href=""https://gamificationplus.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gamificationplus.uk/</a>
I started with a fixed position navigation that travelled down the page as you scrolled. This was based on month of the story. However, conceptually I started to have difficulty with dates and months, as it may feel too constricted and also unrealistic (or worse still idealistic) for the audience. I decided that it would be better to structure the timeline aspect around activities that take place in-time; as due to a collection of possibly delaying factors who knows <em>when</em> our fictional patient's operation will actually take place. The positioning also ran counter to established navigation design patterns and would likely confuse users.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1072""]<img style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/01navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 1"" width=""1072"" height=""612"" /> Nav test 1[/caption]
While I was still thinking about months. I also tried placing the months at the top of the page. You will notice that I added mock-up navigation for the future pages on the top-right as well. Although I have shifted my thinking on the items in the navigation - <strong>About</strong> is the same as the <strong>Patient</strong>; the patient is a fictional device to explain the project. <strong>About</strong> should actually be <strong>Team</strong> as we need to introduce the more about the team and the goals for the project. <strong>Devices</strong> can stay as-is as this will be used to describe potential device types and physiological measurements/sensors per device.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1072""]<img class=""size-medium"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/02navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 2"" width=""1072"" height=""621"" /> Nav test 2[/caption]
I kept the <strong>next</strong> buttons with the top navigation, as you can see from the screenshot below. However, after thinking on it, it really seemed like the <strong>next</strong> buttons were the most useful. Especially as they could offer more scope for styling later on and they allowed the user to progress through the timeline or steps of the patient story in a sequential way. Also in IE, if these buttons are hidden because the function is unavailable then the page will still have logical navigation based on either scrolling or using the arrow keys.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1070""]<img style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/03navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 2.5"" width=""1070"" height=""618"" /> Nav test 2.5[/caption]
In the end I liked the <strong>next</strong> buttons as shown below (at 100% width) and then some kind of floating page navigation on the top-right. I shall have to look at some design patterns and have a think about the best way of doing that.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""911""]<img style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 3"" width=""911"" height=""540"" /> Nav test 3[/caption]
Then after the first <strong>Next </strong>button is clicked here is how the next section of the prototype looks (see Nav test 3.5 below). There is a nice amount of area for information.
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""913""]<img class=""size-medium"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04_5navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 3.5"" width=""913"" height=""607"" /> Nav test 3.5[/caption]
The next step is to create a CSS grid system to ensure that alignment is accurate (as you can see above the text is not placed correctly). I found <a href=""http://j4n.co/blog/Creating-your-own-css-grid-system"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this post about grid setup</a> and will refer to it and the <em>Implementing Responsive Design</em> book (Kadlec, 2013).
<h3><strong>More timeline examples</strong></h3>
I found <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/about"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this timeline by DuckDuckGo</a> and it has completed shifted my thinking in terms of what is possible with a combination a horizontal timeline and a vertical layout site. This could be a really good direction to take with the design. I love the deceivingly simple design and the content is also pleasingly responsive. Having dug into the coding a bit, I love that the timeline itself if actually composed from a series of squares with ""border-radius: 100%"" in the CSS. No IE9 support and it is CSS3, sitting at just over 93% supported (according to caniuse.com: <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=border-ra"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://caniuse.com/#search=border-ra</a>). If Dr. Fotis likes this layout then I shall look at whether I can adapt what I have so far to a horizontal layout with targets&lt;fn&gt;It is really hard to tell what DuckDuckGo are doing in terms of the .js I can't tell which library they are using, if any.&lt;/fn&gt;. My only criticism with this timeline is that you want to click on the <em>year</em> bubbles and they do not do anything.
Here are some examples of infographics from the British Medical Journal, which might be helpful:
<strong>The BMJ timeline:
</strong><a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2767/infographic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2767/infographic</a>
<strong>Timeline or flow with decisions:</strong> <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h3036/infographic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h3036/infographic</a>
<strong>Vertical timeline infographics </strong>- some nice examples here:
<a href=""http://designinstruct.com/roundups/10-infographics-that-will-teach-you-about-typography/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://designinstruct.com/roundups/10-infographics-that-will-teach-you-about-typography/</a>
<strong>Vertical typeface timeline </strong>- I like the very clear layout for this one, even if it not the most information-rich example: <a href=""http://www.minespress.com/timeline-of-10-famous-fonts-infographic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.minespress.com/timeline-of-10-famous-fonts-infographic/</a>
<strong>Horizontal timeline design </strong>- I'm not a fan of stock chart designs, but this one is eerily reminiscent<strong> of my own design for the anxiety levels - worth mentioning as I am not copying it!:</strong> <a href=""https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-illustration-timeline-infographic-flat-design-template-infographics-growth-image41562210"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-illustration-timeline-infographic-flat-design-template-infographics-growth-image41562210</a>
<h4><strong>A journey down the wrong path</strong></h4>
I investigated using javascript to dynamically resize the the coloured box sections based on browser window size. I thought this would be a good plan as I want the <strong>next</strong> buttons to appear in the same place on the page regardless of screen/window size. It became apparent that this was not the correct approach and having spent a reasonable amount of time pursuing it. JQuery
Here are a few things that I found along the way.
Textarea auto resize vanilla javascript - this could well be useful in the future: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/ugin/5779160"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gist.github.com/ugin/5779160</a>
This is sort of cool, but I am not sure of when/if I would need it (removing, resizing and snapping windows): <a href=""https://codepen.io/zz85/post/resizing-moving-snapping-windows-with-js-css"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://codepen.io/zz85/post/resizing-moving-snapping-windows-with-js-css</a>
Tried to use querySelectorAll but couldn't get it working correctly:
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll</a>
box-sizing - I just found out more about this which was helpful and spent some time checking out Marcus' example responsive site:
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing
</a>Marcus' example: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://itsuite.it.brighton.ac.uk/mw159/demo/responsive/
</a>I realised that I definitely needed a border-box due to everything needing to be inside the box! At close to 98% supported, that isn't too bad (<a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=border-box"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://caniuse.com/#search=border-box</a>).
Useful site that I found and believe Marcus also recommended, youmightnotneedsjquery.com:
<a href=""http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#outer_height"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#outer_height</a>
This is also a useful snippet to keep hold of for later as it could be helpful for calculations. I tried it in the Google Chrome console:
<a href=""https://gist.github.com/joshcarr/2f861bd37c3d0df40b30"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gist.github.com/joshcarr/2f861bd37c3d0df40b30

What I was aiming to write was something along the lines of this: <a href=""https://coderwall.com/p/czodeg/set-width-and-height-based-on-viewport-dimentions-vanilla-javascript"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://coderwall.com/p/czodeg/set-width-and-height-based-on-viewport-dimentions-vanilla-javascript</a>
Also I found this, which might be handy to keep for later:
<a href=""https://css-tricks.com/scaled-proportional-blocks-with-css-and-javascript/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://css-tricks.com/scaled-proportional-blocks-with-css-and-javascript/</a>
This led me to find out more about window.innerHeight: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight</a>
I ended up using viewport height (""vh"") for now but it might not be a robust solution at only <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=vh"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">82.55% support</a> (at the time of writing). It is CSS3 value and will have some compatibility issues: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1575141/make-div-100-height-of-browser-window"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1575141/make-div-100-height-of-browser-window</a>

A shorter journal entry for today. I am going to provide a brief outline of what I have been working on, as I need to crack on with planning materials and more development work this week.
<!--more-->
<ul>
 	<li>I have completed an initial version of the Lean Business Model Canvas, as mentioned <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"">in my earlier post</a> referencing UX documentation and design artefacts. I obtained the template recommendation in Cao &amp; Bank's (n.d.) book on UX documentation (the template is available at this URL: <a href=""http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbase/resource-library/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lean-Business-Model-Canvas-template.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbase/resource-library/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lean-Business-Model-Canvas-template.pdf</a>).</li>
 	<li>I have asked my friend Jason to take a look at my code for the arrow button navigation, so I will work on some more tweaks to that tomorrow.</li>
 	<li>Due to extremely limited time this week as a result of some unanticipated work commitments, I haven't got as much development work in as I would like. So I have focused on a few fixes on this site as they were smaller thinks that I could achieve in the time that I had.
<ul>
 	<li>I removed a superfluous hyperlink in the footer.php - it was a <em>copy and paste</em> mistake.</li>
 	<li>I decided not to ""provide a choice of fonts"" (see <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/31/development-prototypes/"">last post</a>) as it felt like it might offer too many options.</li>
 	<li>I decided to install the <a href=""https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WP Accessibility Plugin </a>- I have worked with it before and found it to be one of the best plugins in this area. It offers user-facing tools and some javascript additions to fix common issues in WordPress. Even though I have an accessibility tagged theme, there are additional tweaks that can be completed such as removing title attributes in areas where they aren't needed and enforcing alt tags. It also allows you to add an active link highlight, which I am initially trying out with a contrast tested purple colour (essentially it puts a box around any active element).</li>
 	<li>I worked on a few customisations of the plugin:
<ul>
 	<li>I added it to a sidebar widget instead of the toolbar that is typically used with the plugin. This is mainly due to some issue with the display of the toolbar and also it made sense to present the accessibility options above the background colour options.</li>
 	<li>I customised the font-family and font-size of the text in the accessibility widget.</li>
 	<li>I enabled the high-contrast and font-size (large text) options as part of the WP Accessibility Plugin.</li>
 	<li>I customised aspects of the large text display so that it worked better with the theme, initially some text was too and some was too small. For example, H2 was a too small in comparison to the paragraph text and stylistically and readability-wise it wasn't great.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>I also changed the text-transform settings on the widgets header text as I noticed that these were all uppercase. This is not the best for Dyslexic readers according to Gov.uk's recent accessibility posters (<a href=""https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility/posters_en-UK"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility/posters_en-UK</a>). I find this series of posters to be very helpful cheat-sheets for accessible design.
<ul>
 	<li>Related findings:
<ul>
 	<li>Gov.uk Accessible Blog: <a href=""https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dos and don'ts on designing for accessibility</a></li>
 	<li>Gov.uk Government Digital Service: <a href=""https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/20/user-testing-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">User testing accessibility</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Also in my travels I found the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) - this was recommended both by the WP Accessibility Plugin authors in the documentation and on the Gov.uk page above on the ""making your service accessible"" page.</li>
 	<li>The report (although it will change as the site is being updated)<a href=""http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/</a>
WAVE highlighted some more bits that I need to work on and I do still need to look at the contrast of the text in comparison to the background in the different colour schemes. The ""making your service accessible"" page states that automatic tools like WAVE can only detect a proportion of issues (around 20%-30%: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction</a>). So I need to ensure that I don't regard these tests as exhaustive moving forward.</li>
</ul>
I feel that I have learned quite a bit about accessibility through my work on this journal site, as well as honing my existing skills. So I will take these ideas and techniques forward with me as I continue to work on my portfolio project.

<ul>
	<li>Includes: Apple School Manager and the classroom app
<ul>
	<li>Enabled shared iPad for students</li>
	<li>Classroom app for iPad - like a teaching assistant and classroom control application</li>

<code>---Marc Bernard - 09:45 - New collaboration features in iWork---</code>
Components of iWork:
<ul>
	<li>Pages</li>
	<li>Numbers</li>
	<li>Keynote</li>
</ul>
Lara (Havord) and Marc demonstrate the collaborative functions - scenario is that they went on a field trip to the Tower of London and they want to collaborate on the materials in order to create a school trip report and presentation.
[aside] The Wi-Fi at the venue is not working, I am fairly impressed that they are Bluetoothing directly to the AppleTV. That is thinking on your feet. [/aside]
You just need to get the link to the other person in order to start collaborating in iWork - this could be via iCloud email, iMessage, airdrop or <a href=""https://www.showbie.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Showbie app</a>.
Lara and Marc show how two people can simultaneously work one document. The live changes are shown in the original document real-time if the app is open.
The add people function is found under the more option [...] on the top-right hand side of the app. Audience Q: What is the limit for the number of collaborators? They will come back to that, but it sounds like they haven't tested the limit. Answer to the limit question - 100 people maximum!
Demonstrate the use of app multitasking in order to use Safari look up some information to enrich their presentation. They are now working Keynote to build a joint presentation for their field trip.
Marc then demonstrates how to use Apple maps to find some information about the Tower of London. In the top-right corner there is an (i) symbol which will provide options, such as adding directions to a map. However in the example, Marc uses Apple maps to load a satellite view. He uses the 3D flyover mode and then takes some screenshots in order to produce some more images for their joint presentation.
Marc now wants to add some media rich content to the presentation. They are now demonstrating the use of iMovie app to create a short video using photos taken during their hypothetical field trip to the Tower of London. Lara arranges the photos on the timeline taking advantage of the Ken Burns effect and then records a voiceover and exports the project.
They pop back into the collaborative Keynote project and then place the movie from the media browser.
<strong>Final function - Keynote live</strong>
Generates a link and it will publish the presentation to the Internet and then you can control the presentation from the iPad. In theory with stable Wi-Fi this could be used for wireless presentation from an iPad. Definitely worth a test in a classroom.
<code>----10.15 - iOS10 and 10.20 - Accessibility with iOS 10----</code>
Steve - works in teacher training and also in universities.
Asks us to think about how we might use the functionality in our own teaching contexts.
Steve is going to start by talking about Notes as the example app.
Does multitasking actually help? For the browser I would say yes.
<strong>Safari function revelation as a result of multitasking!!</strong> Drag a tab off the safari browser to the right-hand side and then get split screen! Perfect for comparisons between sources, e.g. you could use this for the Guardian vs. the Daily Mail.
OpenDyslexic keyboard can be added as an additional keyboard, I have also added the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/myscript-stylus-handwriting/id931394264?mt=8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">My Stylus app</a> as a supplemental keyboard to enable handwriting as a keyboard. This was a tip from Craig Wakefield! Here is how to add a supplemental keyboard: <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202178"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202178</a>
Also folks often miss the new drawing tools in the Notes app which can be used for classroom notes and for quick annotations.
<strong>Accessibility</strong>
Talks about how useful the zoom tool can be for teaching. SEE Settings &gt; General &gt; Zoom. A double-tap with three fingers will bring it up and a double-tap with three finger would dismiss it. The window can also be resized by pressing at the bottom of the zoom lens.
Magnifier can be used nicely as a visualiser. When it is turned on a triple-click on the home button will then turn on the camera with enhanced magnification. It does have a freeze option, which is helpful if you are using it as a teaching visualiser.
<strong>The BIGGY</strong>: SEE Settings &gt; Display Accommodations &gt; Colour filters &gt; turn on colour filters and then select the intensity and hue. This will CHANGE my life for reading and is helpful for both colour bling and dyslexic users. It is the colour overlay that we have all been looking for!
Speech has added functions for correcting pronunciations. This is helpful when you use speech for reading out loud. I use this function a lot for reading out PDFs of academic papers and there are some technical words, which are frequently mispronounced so this will be helpful for correcting that.
Demonstrates <strong>Switch Control</strong> - this is where the devices camera can be used in order to use the device. The camera looks for your head tilting the the left or right, this can be used to control on the on-screen functions.
<strong>Guided access</strong> can be used to focus attention, lock to a specific app and make parts of the screen inaccessible. See General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Guided Access. This will allow you to kiosk to a single app and then control which functions are available within the app.

<code>----10.50 - Deployment----</code>
Luke and Stewart - Systems Engineers - Introduce New Learning Environments
The message: ""Making it easier for schools to put devices in the hands of students.""
An audience member mentioned use of Meraki, so they will come back to that.
9.3 signifies a shift towards the addition of more educational functionality.
<ul>
	<li>Classroom app</li>
	<li>Shared iPad</li>
	<li>Apple School manager
<ul>
	<li>Managed IDs inside apple manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Shared iPad feature:</strong>
Gives you a personalised experience on a shared iPad. Login with an AppleID and then their personal information is synchronised back up to the cloud. [Audience point: provided they remember their passwords - will come back to this as it can be easier than AppleID].
Takeaway from today: taking control of a group of devices and waking them all up simultaneously. Control activity on the devices.
Apple School manager: allows for the creation of bulk AppleID on behalf of students. Can supply up to 100,000 IDs at one time.
Best things about shared iPad:
<ul>
	<li>Photo ID lets students find their iPad fast</li>
	<li>Log in with Managed Apple IDs</li>
	<li>Simplified login for younger students</li>
	<li>Data stored in the cloud and cached on device</li>
	<li> You decide the number of students for each iPad (e.g. if you allow 6 students, then the 7th student will bump off the oldest profile. The oldest profile will be backed up to the managed iCloud account).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Can use Classroom app to manage exams and lock down to only specific application and disallow multitasking. You can simultaneously lock all devices at a given point.</strong>
Classroom app key functions:
<ul>
	<li>Launch and lock apps</li>
	<li>See what your students see</li>
	<li>Create groups of students</li>
	<li>Share student work over AirPlay</li>
	<li>Reset forgotten passwords</li>
</ul>
As long as the device is enrolled in the MDM then it can be used with Classroom - it will depend on configuration planning.
You can put the devices into classes - e.g. if you only have one set of iPads for the school then you might find that putting the iPads into a single class.
Assign functionality:
Scenario - walk into the classroom and pick up an iPad and immediately sign-in. Must take the lest amount of time possible.
The assign feature throws up the name and face of the student who used the iPad last so that they can return to using that iPad that they already have their data on them. It is fine for the student to use a different iPad, but it will be more seamless for the student to return to the iPad that they had already used.
Create groups of students - so students can be assigned to separate tasks in the room on the devices.
Multiple instructors can have access to the classroom and can manage the students.
Using airplay in conjunction with the classroom app will allow you to share a student's work to the classroom display system.
The Classroom app is:
<ul>
	<li>Available for free in the App Store</li>
	<li>Configure and deploy with MDM</li>
</ul>
<strong>Apple School Manager</strong>
""Think of it as the hub for your deployment from an administrative perspective"". It sits alongside MDM.
<ul>
	<li>If it is admin (buying stuff, managing IDs) it is Apple School Manager</li>
	<li>If it is to do with device configuration then it is your MDM.</li>
</ul>
Important question: how do I get all of my roster information into Apple School Manager.
There is a function coming soon that will allow direct plugin to data in systems like capita.
At the moment this is facilitated by CSV import. You need to setup an SFTP connection as well. - More information needed on this.
Photo information is held by the MDMs, not by Apple School Manager.
If you are using a device enrolment programme you can bring all of the devices and apps purchased in the institution can be brought into Apple School Manager.
<strong>From now on if you want to buy Apps and Books in bulk you will use Apple School Manager.</strong>
<strong>iTunesU is going to become more integrated within Apple School Manager - this is going to become more like a VLE. With materials and grades displayed together and the ability to enrol students in classes.</strong>
<strong>More points about Apple School Manager:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Designed for education</li>
	<li>Created in bulk through Apple School manager</li>
	<li>Managed by schools and districts</li>
	<li>Supports multiple roles</li>
</ul>
Have flexibility in your AppleID naming conventions. So for example username could be used, e.g. in my case fjm15@myschool
<strong>Roles and </strong><b>privileges</b>
Content manager role: don't see anything to do with people or students, but you could buy books and apps.
Essentially there is a role for any level of access you might need.
<strong>New Management Features</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Show and hide apps (you can hide things like photos app and iMessage)</li>
	<li>Home screen layout (you can define folders and layout of apps).</li>
	<li>Lost mode (e.g. if found then return to...)</li>
	<li>Additional restrictions (notification settings can be restricted so that students aren't dinged by badges and pop-ups encouraging them to update).</li>
</ul>
<code>----Hands-on classroom demonstration----</code>
When you launch the classroom app then you are shown a list of classes so that you can pull up your student list/roster.
<strong>Individual iPad versus Shared</strong> <strong>iPad</strong>
<strong>This is where the Assign function comes</strong> <strong>in.</strong>
When you press Assign the classroom app tells you how many devices are available in the room. Then you can assign the iPads to groups of students and then you can see which stage all the students are at in the room (little app icons are shown next to student names on the photo roster). Everyone selects their own passcode at first login.
Demonstrates ""open app"" function so well all are taken into the teacher's selected app. Then you can specify that the app is locked after opening - the students cannot exit the app. Even if you put the iPad to sleep then you wake up the device you are still locked into the app. If you do a hard reset then you will be removed from the controlled environment. Unlock, means that the students are released from the app but not automatically taken out of the app.
Navigate options: iBooks, iTunesU and Safari
The teacher can use the share button on the top-right of safari to automatically share a web page with the class, so this could be used to pre-cue the content.
Also there is a mini view of all the iPad screens in the classroom app. While the teacher is reviewing the iPad screens then the blue bar (like AirPlay) is shown to indicate that the students' activities are under review. If you press on an individual student from the ""Screens"" area then you can quickly AirPlay a student's screen to the classroom display system.
Groups could be used for assigning activities, but also for allowing exam exceptions if the devices were used in a controlled situation, this could also be locked into a specific app or web page.
You can also enforce logout for students - so this triggers the synchronisation to iCloud process.
If you are using Volume Purchase Programme - it will only consume one licence even though there multiple users on the iPad.
Existing AppleIDs cannot be ingested into Apple School Manager.
<code>----11:50 - Teacher Resources----</code>
Links to these will be shared later - I'll add the links here when I have them.
Helpful series of Apple iBooks - new guides for using apps in education. These are available for iPads and for Macs.
Part of a series of books under the ""Apple teacher"" heading in iBooks.
<code>----12.00 - Discussion tables----</code>
Swift Playgrounds certainly isn't <a href=""http://www.appinventor.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Android app inventor</a> - it <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">is</span> a nice iPad app. For HE, in terms of language learning, you need something that is device agnostic and doesn't involve installing bulky SDKs (aka Xcode) for it to be scalable in a higher education setting I feel. So to summarise, I like Swift as a language and I like Swift Playgrounds as an individual activity, but something more like Code Academy in the web browser would be more useful for teaching at HE level.
<strong>Overall:</strong> an interesting day and I learned quite a bit.

Don't worry I haven't forgotten about these things, but they are having to happen gradually alongside my formative code learning and experimentation, so they will be attached to future entries.<!--more-->
<h2>Portfolio development</h2>
One thing I have learned from working in IT for 7+ years is that it is best not to say what you will build until you know what you can build. Sometimes this is knowing the right people who can build it for you, sometimes this is knowing the right tools to use in order to build. With this in-mind I decided to use a long weekend off work to create some coding prototypes to check if what I was envisioning in my mind is actually possible. This is completely opposite of what I would do with UX where I design the interface first without getting too attached to a specific technology. This is okay, but there is value in understanding what can be achieved, especially as I am doing it all myself!
<h3>Prototype 1</h3>
My first prototype was a simple site based on the html5 &lt;section&gt; element&lt;fn&gt;Learned about this from pp. 18-19 and p.54 of the Introducing HTML 5 book (Lawson &amp; Sharp, 2012).&lt;/fn&gt;. My thought was that in a later iteration it would resemble something like this site: <a href=""http://www.akita.co.uk/computing-history/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.akita.co.uk/computing-history/</a> where container &lt;div&gt;s are added to the sections in order to align written and image-based content. I started by using header level ID tags as anchors for navigation through the content and then used the ""tabindex"" to determine navigation with the tab key. This prototype was fine, but I felt immediately frustrated by the jerkiness of the navigation; this would certainly take away from the experience of reading the content.
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8CQzRYzoM5s?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
<h3>Prototype 2</h3>
I asked Marcus for some advice about how best to implement a script to support smooth navigation. I had already done quite a bit of Google searching for a solution to this, but everything that I found involved jQuery &lt;fn&gt;For example this post on StackOverflow: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6677035/jquery-scroll-to-element/6677069#6677069"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6677035/jquery-scroll-to-element/6677069#6677069</a>&lt;/fn&gt;. There is nothing inherently wrong with jQuery, but I would prefer not to use any libraries for my site as it may impact loading time and time is crucial (as I said what I am creating is a <em>coffee break</em> website). Also I want to make sure that the code as kept as clean as possible, so that I can see how it works in Internet Explorer 9. This is because unfortunately for me, the bulk of my end-users, use that web browser (an emoticon is unprofessional, but a frown-y face here would articulate my feelings). Marcus suggested that I include the search term ""vanilla"" and this did the trick. Helping me to find an excellent piece of script that I could adapt by P. Gryzybek (see his blog post about it here: <a href=""https://pawelgrzybek.com/page-scroll-in-vanilla-javascript/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://pawelgrzybek.com/page-scroll-in-vanilla-javascript/</a> and the codepen.io source: <a href=""http://codepen.io/pawelgrzybek/pen/QEQoZL"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://codepen.io/pawelgrzybek/pen/QEQoZL</a>).
I have to admit that I did feel a bit guilty for adapting someone else's script, because I would like to have enough knowledge to create one from scratch on my own. However, at the moment my knowledge of the Javascript syntax is lacking a bit; essentially I know what I would like to do but I lack the right grammar to do it! So adapting other people's scripts, which I then cite in the comments is a good way to for me to learn.
In prototype 2, shown below, buttons are used to trigger the smooth scrolling. The smooth scrolling function itself is based on moving between sections as parts of an array (Crockford, 2008, p.58). This is a clean way of doing it as there is a clear chronology and index in the array and the scrolling movement reflects that. However, the array also meant that I needed to rethink my structure and consider naming properties carefully. For example, in the original script the parts of the array were called ""sections"" I knew immediately that I had to change that as I planned to use HTML5 sections, so having ""sections"" in the javascript would become confusing for anyone who needed to review my code later on. Therefore I changed that aspect to be ""parts"" in the .js file. Also I decided to introduce a new series of buttons with the purpose of moving from section to section of the site. These ""Next"" buttons use the same javascript ""scrollIt"" function but are independent from the section navigation buttons that float at the top-left, this will allow me to style them separately in the CSS later on. The arrays were both useful and frustrating as there are 12 ""Next"" buttons, whereas there are 13 sections (0-12) in the sections/parts array. This means that the ""Next"" buttons need to be staggered, so the ""Next"" button indexed at ""0"" points to ""1"", and ""1"" points to ""2"" and so on and so forth. This is a downside of reusing the ScrollIt function's array but better than adding another layer of script to run through.
The other thing that I spent way too much time on is trying to add keyboard-based navigation to prototype 2. I tried a few approaches including a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/switch_command_JavaScript"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>Switch</em></a> (this was most effective) picking up the values of the up (=38) and down (=40) keyCode values. I also tried to construct <em>if </em> and <em><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">do...while</a> </em>statements in javascript. However, try as I might I could not get the repeated use of the down key to keep going down the list, I could only get it going down to the second position and then it got stuck. I will need to seek advice on this and come back to it.
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRcH_KIdhmE?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
Having said all this, I am pretty happy with prototype 2 as a starting point and I feel that it can provide the structure needed for the next steps. So NOW I am ready to do more on wireframing and possibly physical prototyping.
As a start for the creation of these prototypes I used the <a href=""https://html5boilerplate.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> that is available on GitHub. It seemed like a good way of familiarising myself with all the parts that would be needed for a fully fledged HTML5 application. There are many template parts that I will likely discard, but it was certainly helpful to start this way and it provided a logical filing structure.
My new GitHub repository specifically for the portfolio project can be found here: <a href=""https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/portfolioproj"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/portfolioproj</a>
I also added a Normalize.css file based on this template from GitHub: <a href=""https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/5.0.0/normalize.css"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/5.0.0/normalize.css</a>
Based on Marcus's session this week, it is a good idea to include a normalize.css file as it standardises the browsers' built-in interpretation of styles.
<h3>Journal developments</h3>
I asked Marcus for some advice on the background colour changing widget (aka stylesheet switcher) and he felt that loading images for the colour-change buttons added to the processing load. I tried a few things in the MAMP version of this journal on my development computer, including changing the images to 1 pixel and then also trying to create <em>buttons</em> that could just be a colour and not a jpeg or png image file. None of these things worked well and I came to the conclusion that as I am working with a plugin and some of these tweaks broke the plugin, I just need to handle the plugin's limitations. As I don't have enough time to build my own plugin, I decided to made the images small and simple at 20px x 20px and then altered the stylesheet to make the layout more uniform so that they fit into the sidebar widget better and are shown in a row at most browser window sizes (the widget disappears at phone screen size, this is intentional in the Twentysixteen parent theme, to avoid clutter).
In addition, I added a piece of loading script at the top of each colour-option CSS file as I need each one to load the child theme's CSS, so that I don't need to make changes to all of the CSS files, only the main child theme version. I mapped the stylesheet switcher plugin's php to look in the ""css"" folder, but I also found that the main child style.css file needed to live in the root folder in order to operate properly (thank you Google Chrome console for highlighting this issue!).
A further development for the stylesheet switcher will be to look at the default hyperlink colours in relation to each background. This includes their active, inactive and visited states as the contrast in relation to the background colour needs to be readable for each colour.
Additional considerations:
<ul>
 	<li>do I want to provide a choice of fonts and if so, would I provide that function via a different plugin?</li>
 	<li>I should look at installing the <a href=""https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">accessibility plugin</a> and investigating the best settings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development log</h3>
It struck me that I am adding a lot of short notes and written updates to GitHub. I felt like it would be good to maintain a digest of these changes and thoughts in this journal, alongside my longer form writing. Therefore I did a bit of searching and found information about the atom feeds for ""commit"" changes (here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7353538/setting-up-an-github-commit-rss-feed"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7353538/setting-up-an-github-commit-rss-feed</a>). In order to display this feed, I needed an aggregator. I selected the CyberSyn plugin as it has been updated recently and offers excellent functionality (<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/cybersyn/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/cybersyn/</a>). However, as the GitHub commit posts are a bit code-like and lacking correct grammar, I don't want them on the front page of this journal but <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/category/dev-log/"">in their own category</a>. So I set the CyberSyn plugin to set all feed posts as a new ""development log"" category and used the Ultimate Category Excluder (<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-category-excluder/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-category-excluder/</a>) plugin to omit that category from the front page posts feed. I'm pretty happy with that!

1039,1,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,"On Monday 24th of October, I attended a WordPress meet-up or rather ""Word-up"" event at the Barclay's Eagle Lab building in Brighton. The event was in two parts, the first part was a talk by prolific blogger, Livia Farkas and the second part was a user testing presentation/discussion.<!--more--> It was good to hear about the different plugins that Farkas uses in order to best serve her audience of subscribers many of whom are Hungarian. This presents interesting translation challenges from WordPress core's english, but also presents unique opportunities. She has managed to monetise her site through production of PDFs guides, print materials and short online courses related to women's lifestyle interests. A large part of her success seems to be derived from her carefully maintained email list and this is one of the potential benefits of using a CMS like WordPress. The vast range of plugins allow for expansion and can provide very powerful tools for driving traffic to your web content. With a site coded from the ground-up it is harder to integrate these elements and you may end up having to pay for several external services in order to manage these functions.
With WordPress the content is married-up to a multitude of plugins, allowing for self-service functionality. Although the downside, as I have hinted at in earlier posts is that plugins can become deprecated when they are no longer actively maintained by developers. So you always need to choose wisely AND be ready to jump ship and use an alternative plugin, which may impact the breadth of functionality.
<h2>User testing and accessibility discussion</h2>
The second part of the evening featured a short presentation on user testing. This was followed by a discussion/critique of websites by the people in the room. The first site that we looked at was for copyrighting agency. It was a very well-considered site, although there was a bit too much white space and this raised the issue of accessibility.
This provided an ideal opportunity for me to show this site and discuss some of the issues that the recent trend towards sparse black or grey-on-white design can present in terms of readability, navigation and contrast perception for disabled end-users. I showed this site's background colour switcher, as well as a code experiment from a couple of years ago showing what it is like for me to read black text on a white background (<a href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/</a>). I also showed the WordPress accessibility plugin (<a href=""https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/</a>), which I have installed on my work blog (see toolbar on the left: <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/</a>). Many folks had not heard of the plugin, so I felt like I was doing my bit to help promote awareness in this area. Overall the discussion was really interesting and I may consider talking at next year's WordCamp Brighton on the topic of accessibility. Alas there was not enough time in the end to run any user testing on my site, but the feedback was helpful nonetheless.

1040,1,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,"Over the past three weeks since the start of the module, I have been working away on the development of my portfolio site concept and gaining domain knowledge to support the development process. I have found myself in a situation where I have been torn between completing the UX procedures and design artefacts that I learned about and implemented during previous modules and starting to code. It is like standing at the edge of an exciting, and slightly daunting, precipice wondering whether to make the leap. The good news is, I am close.<!--more-->
I must also at this point, state that I aim to make a real and useful website. It will be short and sweet but it will, hypothetically at least, fulfill a real-world purpose. I also hope that it will be possible to use the site to support future research work that I plan to undertake.
<h3>Process: A minimalist approach influenced by LEAN UX</h3>
I have found that I cannot bypass the UX design artefacts and documentation entirely as they have become part of the fundamental fabric of my thought processes! So I have decided to complete a very stripped down version, to ensure that I have a solid architectural foundation for what I am about to build. This approach will be composed of the following elements.
<ol>
<ol>
 	<li>A concept document in a bare bones form aka this journal entry!</li>
 	<li>Task scenarios - <a title=""a long link to a Google document viewer"" href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nxisu8BaAGM3iaJ1r7oZv4b-XAM59ZMapdnNgK0rQzc/edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this document</a> is the first version.</li>
 	<li>Business Model Canvas&lt;fn&gt;
Business Model Canvas (<a href=""http://www.businessmodelcanvas.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.businessmodelcanvas.com</a>), licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported licenses (<a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a>).&lt;/fn&gt; - an artefact template that I found via Cao &amp; Bank's, <em>The Guide to UX Design Process &amp; Documentation</em> (n.d.). This will be in a forthcoming journal entry.</li>
 	<li>General characteristics for user groups - this will also be in a forthcoming journal entry. Due to time contraints and available information, it is not possible to build thorough characteristics lists for all potential users. I am however, fortunate to have a real stakeholder who can provide feedback on my work and it's hypothetical usefulness. (more on this later on in this entry).</li>
 	<li>[Tentative plan] create a UML&lt;fn&gt;Unified Modeling Language - more information at wikipedia: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language</a>&lt;/fn&gt; diagram to ensure that each page and section of the site includes the correct information and functions. I personally find UML diagrams to be very helpful for archictectural planning. It can be a fairly basic model for this project, but I do find that the process of making the models uncovers things that you haven't thought about! I may find that this isn't needed, but I won't know until I start making it.</li>
 	<li>A paper prototype - as I am working with a real stakeholder, I want to show him something quick and easy so that he can visualise the concept and ensure that my representation and approach to the domain is accurate. I think that a paper prototype is the best way to do that, in order to move to the coding phase as quickly as possible.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<h3>Concept</h3>
The wait is over! Here is the concept.
The project's working title is <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic.</em> It is a website structured around a central page, which leads the viewer through a fictional narrative of a patient's experience of anxiety while awaiting a medical operation or procedure. In the narrative the patient will be using an electronic wearable device to track their own vital signs and also for logging their anxiety levels - the influence of this countermeasure will be explored. The narrative is represented through a navigable timeline enriched with the use of graphical, written and statistical information. The underlying project, to use wearable devices to measure patient pre-operative anxiety is attributed to and courtesy of Dr. Theofanis Fotis (School of Health Sciences, University of Brighton), whom I am collaborating with at this time.</span>
<strong>Scope</strong>
The <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>deliver an approachable overview of a research project - the proposed research project is to design a user interface for a medical wearable device to measure anxiety;</li>
 	<li>explain the issues that can result from pre-operative stress in patients;</li>
 	<li>provide a point of entry for those with little or no knowledge of the subject as well as explain the potential benefits of the project to experienced medical professionals.</li>
</ul>
The <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will not:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>provide indepth medical information;</li>
 	<li>provide any fully formed solutions or recommendations for implementation of wearable devices in a medical setting;</li>
 	<li>provide advice or suggestions for the production of patient care plans. As a narrative scenario it is exploring a hypothetical scenario in which a wearable device is used.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Benefits</strong>
The <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic </em>will provide the following benefits:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>it will provide a valuable resource for explaining the research project to potential funders and future stakeholders;</li>
 	<li>it will help to raise awareness of the potential issues related to patient pre-operative anxiety;</li>
 	<li>it will highlight potential ways that increased knowledge of a patient's vital signs and self-reported anxiety could improve patient care;</li>
 	<li>it will provide an accompanying contextual information for the proposed future interface design project;</li>
 	<li>it will be a publicity tool, that can be used to explain the project within the academic and medical online communities.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Goals</strong>
The following goals are related to the successful creation of the <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic:</em></span>
<ul>
 	<li>provide a valuable portfolio piece, not only in terms of web development, but also as a tool for the research team and collaborators;</li>
 	<li>contribute to the approval and ethics approval of this as a concept for F.MacNeill's final graduating project;</li>
 	<li>stimulate dialogue around the issues and ideas raised by the <em>p</em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>atient pre-op anxiety infographic;</em></span></li>
 	<li>encourage potential funders and stakeholders to invest in the project.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Objectives</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Create an accurate portrayal of a possible patient care scenario.</li>
 	<li>Provide information highlighting the benefits of the proposed project.</li>
 	<li>Pose the project concept as an open question in order to gauge feedback and interest from the medical community and potential funders and/or stakeholders.</li>
 	<li>The user audiences for this are diverse but have one thing in common, they have very limited time to engage with a website of this kind. This website should take no longer than 10-15mins to navigate, the equivalent of a typical coffee/tea break.</li>
 	<li>To be shared via social media between interested parties.</li>
 	<li>To be adaptive and easily viewed and navigated on mobile devices.</li>
 	<li>To be accessible to those on older web browsers (as far as possible).</li>
 	<li>To be accessible to users with disabilities, allowing for personal customisation (as far as possible).</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Research Team</strong>
Right now this is just me, however Dr. Fotis has agreed to review the materials and my hope is that if the site meets his approval then we will be able to use it to promote the real project. In the first instance it is a hypothetical project site, but that doesn't mean that you cannot aim high as I have outlined in the objectives above.
<strong>Audience</strong>
More detail on this in a future entry.
The user groups are: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">funding review panel members, academic staff at multiple Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), medical professionals.</span>
<strong>Stakeholders</strong>
Intially Dr. Fotis is the main stakeholder, however I would take this site forward as evidence to support my final project proposal. In that sense academic staff in the School of Computing are also future stakeholders.
<h3>Research of the domain and existing websites</h3>
I have been using my <a href=""https://trello.com/b/4a20fYpf/web-development-portfolio-project"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Trello project board</a> as a place to collect links and resources. On the one hand I have been looking at the specs for potential wearable devices, it is out of scope to suggest an actual solution but I would like to supply some possibilities in terms of device form so that the project is tangible. I have also been reviewing materials that Dr. Fotis provided to help gain domain knowledge of a patient's pre-operative experience. I have listed these sources in my reference list below.
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ideassketch.jpg""><img class=""size-medium"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ideassketch.jpg"" alt=""Image of a sketch book page, including pencil drawing for the patient journey"" width=""100%"" /></a> Sketch of patient journey ideas
<strong>Existing websites</strong>
As a general observation medical websites tend to be firmly on the utilitarian end of the scale. This is understandable as information is usually important and needs to be delivered quickly. So it will be important to strike a balance between something eye-catching, which is also substantive.
Here is are few examples that I came across and wrote notes about (transferred from my trello board).
<code>-----------------Notes/Observations---------------</code>
This collection of timeline based websites and infographics is really helpful: <a href=""http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/timeline-in-web-design/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/timeline-in-web-design/</a>
Some of the examples are a bit old and don't work as well in contemporary browsers. This is something to consider.
Most of these sites are in a long-form vertical format. This is great and modern, but considering the audio for this site, this obscures some key aspects of the journey. Viewers will be time-pressured and need to see the journey/timeline elements as succinctly as possible. The following sites are closest to what I want to design:
<a href=""http://rodania.com/about"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://rodania.com/about</a>
This example is not very responsive, so that would be something to consider.
<a href=""http://minimalmonkey.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://minimalmonkey.com/</a>
This blog is quite nice but the scrolling right function would need to be made much more obvious.
<hr />
Vertical timeline examples:
I like the intro page segment on this one: <a href=""http://www.akita.co.uk/computing-history/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.akita.co.uk/computing-history/</a>
It isn't keyboard navigable though which is not great in terms of my accessibility goals.
This one is keyboard navigable and it aesthetically simple and user-friendly:<a href=""https://uk.protectyourbubble.com/iphone-timeline/#iphone-2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://uk.protectyourbubble.com/iphone-timeline/#iphone-2</a>
I quite like the simplicity of this one, it is text heavy, but it gets the message across quickly: <a href=""https://mixpanel.com/about/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://mixpanel.com/about/</a>
I like the use of months on the timeline on this portfolio site, although accessibility and control might be an issue here: <a href=""http://www.czk.fr/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.czk.fr/</a>
<hr />
A collection of horizontal scrolling sites: <a href=""https://webdesignledger.com/40-of-the-best-horizontal-scrolling-websites/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://webdesignledger.com/40-of-the-best-horizontal-scrolling-websites/</a>
<blockquote>Many of these are quite old or have changed format since the post was written. <strong>I found myself considering a horizontal layout due to the need to display data and the need for it to be readable, however horizontal layouts pose some real accessibility and navigation issues.</strong></blockquote>
<hr />
Recently updated list of infographics, including many interactive examples: <a href=""http://www.siegemedia.com/creation/best-infographics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.siegemedia.com/creation/best-infographics</a>
An oldie, but a goodie ""The Evolution of the Web"" as an example of a horizontal layout: <a href=""http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/#/evolution/day"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/#/evolution/day</a>
...and some justification for my concept!
13 Reasons Why Your Brain Craves Infographics: <a href=""http://neomam.com/interactive/13reasons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://neomam.com/interactive/13reasons/</a>
<hr />
This site uses the <a href=""https://timeline.knightlab.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Knightlab's Timeline JS tool</a>, which I have used many times, mostly in WordPress sites. This is a nice medical example, but I want something a bit more contemporary: <a href=""http://www.centenary.mrc.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.centenary.mrc.ac.uk/</a>
<blockquote>This site has the kind of section feel that I am looking for, although I still wonder how I can visualise anxiety in a vertical layout versus horizontal: <a href=""http://www.kocha.com.au/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">http://www.kocha.com.au/</a>
This site has nice comment mark-up and makes clear use of the &lt;section&gt; element.</blockquote>

<h3>Journal development</h3>
A quick run down of learning journal development activities. A full rundown can be found on my github development page, I have added a handy link to to this in the ""social menu"" on the right-hand footer of this journal site (circular icon with octo-cat logo).
<strong>Created an iframe embed in a widget for my trello board</strong> so that I can display it in the sidebar. In order to create this I referred to: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/danlec/hmQJP/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://jsfiddle.net/danlec/hmQJP/</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe</a>
Tomorrow I am attending a <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/WordUp-Brighton/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WordPress Meet-up at Barclay's Eagle Lab</a> in Brighton and as part of the event they will offer user testing. I thought why not add some functionality that I have always wanted to include AND get some tips. <strong>I have added the option for visitors to this site to change the colour of the background (behind the text) for accessibility reasons.</strong> I did this as by creating alternate child-theme style sheet and by installing the WP User Stylesheet Switcher plugin: <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-stylesheet-switcher/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-stylesheet-switcher/</a>.
This idea is inspired by software like of Adobe Acrobat Pro and GoodReader App (for iPad) which allow you to customise background colours. I referenced <a href=""http://irlen.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://irlen.com</a> for colour-palette inspiration. Visual stress when reading and/or perception of colour contrast are reasons why a user might wish to alter background colours.
<ul>
 	<li>hexidecimal colours used for initial function:
<ul>
 	<li>blue 1: #dfeced</li>
 	<li>blue 2: #9ab8fc</li>
 	<li>green 1: #a6f8e3</li>
 	<li>green 2: #aaf2a0</li>
 	<li>yellow 1: #ffff8f</li>
 	<li>yellow 2: #ffde75</li>
 	<li>purple: #bf95df</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
I'll write about any resulting feedback and actions on this site later.
<strong>I added Google Analytics code to my version of the header.php file</strong>, this was not added to GitHub as it is specific to my version of the child theme. I decided against a plugin as I looked at a couple of options, but I didn't feel that having access to a Google Analytics data on the dashboard of WordPress was that important as compared to the account authorisation that plugins require to run (e.g. plugin that I looked at: <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-dashboard-for-wp/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-dashboard-for-wp/</a>). I like to keep an eye on web traffic for security and publicity reasons.
<h3>Coding practice</h3>
I have a Lynda.com course to wrap-up and I will post the details here when I finish. In the meantime, collectively I have now completed 200 exercises in Code Academy! I didn't do them all since the start of this module, but here is a screenshot of my badge!

1041,1,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,"I will write a longer post about the investigatory work that I have completed for my portfolio very soon. However in the meantime, I wanted to quickly outline some bug fixes in my child theme. Full details can be found in my GitHub repository here: <a href=""https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal"">https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal</a><!--more-->
These changes were based on reports from the:
<ul>
 	<li>W3C Markup Validation Service (W3C, 2016)</li>
 	<li>IDI Web Accessibility Checker (AChecker, 2016)</li>
</ul>
<h3>&lt;label&gt;</h3>
I finally managed to fix the label tag issue (mentioned in the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/13/theme-testing/#contenders"">""contenders"" section</a> in my last post). It was missing the id, so once I added id = ""search"" into the php file and added &lt;label for =""search"" to the searchform.php file it was sorted. That took a bit of troubleshooting for sure.
<h3>role</h3>
The NU HTML checker flagged some role distinctions that are not required for certain elements in HTML. I could tell that these roles were not needed in my updated child theme, so I removed the tags. These needed to be altered in the following files: header.php, index.php, sidebar.php and footer.php
New versions of these files have all been added to both the child theme folder and my <a href=""https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal"">GitHub repository</a>.
<h3>footer</h3>
I got the footer displaying, not only my freshly minted WCAG 2.0 AA compliance badge&lt;fn&gt;I'll have to keep testing this periodically as things that you add to specific posts can prompt warning. It is a good way to ensure that I pay as much attention to the mark-up as I do to the written content of this journal.&lt;/fn&gt;, but also my design credentials. Doesn't sound like a big thing, but it took me a while to figure out how to adapt the nested php ""echoes"" from the parent theme for my own purposes.
More soon...I'll be working on wireframes this weekend.

In that section I outlined plans to test a number of WordPress themes that had been tagged with accessibility. This led me down a fascinating path of learning with one wrong turn along the way.<!--more-->
<h3>The testing process</h3>
In my last post I outlined a number of themes that looked like possible candidates, including the following:
<ol>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/afterlight/"">afterlight (Automattic, 2015)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/search/chuchadon/"">chuchadon (Keijonen, 2016a)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/e-nigma-2015/"">e-nigma (Lüken, 2015)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/kuorinka/"">kuorinka (Keijonen, 2016b)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/"">twentyfifteen (WordPress.org, 2016a)</a> (WordPress core theme)</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/"">twentysixteen (WordPress.org, 2016b)</a> (WordPress core theme)</li>
</ol>
As part of the testing plan I used a several tools, listed at the bottom of this post, to analyse the best themes. Please note, that some themes did not reach the full testing phase due to issues that I would term as <em>deal breakers</em>; the issues identified were troublesome enough where it was not worth continuing with those themes. I also entered into this testing process with an intention to attain a WCAG 2.0 Level AA (W3C, 2016a) accessibility rating for my journal site. This is largely because accessibility is a budding specialism of mine and I wanted an excuse to delve around in the innards of the newest WordPress themes!
<h4>Testing results and observations</h4>
<ol>
<ol>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/afterlight/"">afterlight</a>
I decided not to install this theme. Although 'afterlight' had the accessibility tag, I found on inspection of its specifications that it is based on having a background image throughout each area of its architecture (landing page, pages, posts - all had to have a single background image). Upon previewing this with my content, using the WordPress theme preview tool, I found that this negatively impacted readability. As the purpose of this blog is to engage in reflection, it seems important not to distract from that at the design level.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/search/chuchadon/"">chuchadon</a>
This theme has (or rather had) a lot of potential and is coded according to best practice (e.g. accessibility tagging) outlined in the WordPress Accessibility Handbook (WordPress.org, 2014).
<div>
I realised later on looking at in-code documentation that this theme is based on a starter theme, Underscores (or “_s”). A bare bones CSS starter theme (Underscores, 2016).
</div>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately after venturing as far as creating a child theme, I found issues in the some of the front-page template functionality. I also discovered that the links through to the theme documentation were broken and as a result I decided cease using the theme.</span></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/e-nigma-2015/"">e-nigma
</a>I do like the clean lines and simplicity of enigma, even in light of the negative points outlined in the slideshow below, it is certainly a worthy candidate. However, the dependence on the burger-style menu (the three lines) although often essential on mobile versions of a site, is less effective when viewed in a conventional web browser. I decided to seek out a theme that offered more versatility for delivery of the navigation menu/s.</li>

</a>Initially I really liked the simplicity of this theme design and it is very responsive, however in terms of accessibility it has some problems. Namely, it does not support reader view in Firefox 49 or Safari 10 and also was not good in terms of respecting the heading levels for the screen reader. I did not complete the other tests as these two issues were deal breakers.</li>

The ultimate in clean and simple. Although as a seasoned WordPress user the annual core template always <em>looks</em> like the annual core template, even with customisation. Twentyfifteen is quite book-like in its bi-fold layout and this doesn't strike the desired tone. As I tend to be quite verbose in my writing, I think that a theme with better except support is better. Having said that, the core templates can provide excellent bases for creation of child themes.
</div></li>

</a>A fresh approach to a traditional blog layout with some very nice built-in features. Highlights include the support of the <em>read more</em> tag for determining the length of post/entry excerpts shown on the front page. I also like the presentation of the author avatar, together with post tags on the left-hand side of each post. This theme has good customisation options and good widget support (the tools that you can place in the aside-style columns in the layout). A solid theme, not the most riveting to look at, but it ticks all of my accessibility boxes!
<h5 id=""contenders"">The final two contenders</h5>
I ran an IDI web accessibility check and used Firefox accessibility checker plugin (SEE <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/13/theme-testing/#tools"">tools section</a> for links) to enable keyboard control on the two top candidates: twentysixteen and chuchadon.
Twentysixteen had two flagged elements when I looked at the posts page specifically - one was that h1 header element was nested, so the order of headers was not ideal. Also there was a missing label element in the search field. These would both be very easy fixes.
<div>
<div>Chuchadon had the same flag on the header nesting for a posts page, so it is likely that this is an issue that would be picked up for a number of WordPress based blog template. To test this theory I tested my own blog, which is based on the Edublogs implementation of WordPress. Interestingly this was not an issue on my blog (e.g. post: <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/06/14/trust-in-iot-app-interfaces-redux/"">MacNeill, 2016</a>) or another Edublog that I tried. I took a look at the .entry-title tag in the edublog and it was at h2 level rather than h1. This struck me as an issue with both these themes. So I created a child theme of Chuchadon to try out a tweak on line 353 of the CSS stylesheet. The tweak worked perfectly, but alas this was also when I realised that there were some other things that didn't work for me in chuchadon (front-page configuration and the documentation links).</div>
</div>
<h5>The final verdict</h5>
I have selected twentysixteen as my theme and have created a child theme to allow more space for customisation.

<strong>Just to clarify...</strong>
You may be asking, what is all this talk of child themes. Well in essence a child theme is augmented version of it's original parent. Essentially a child theme allows you to commit edits to the visual presentation as well as the functions of a WordPress site without editing the original theme's code. This is a smart tactic for customising a theme, particularly the core annual themes, as because WordPress as a CMS has frequent updates, any accompanying parent theme updates can be safely run without affecting the code in the child theme too much. The use of a child theme will also allow me to replace the parts of the CSS and theme functions that were identified in the IDI accessibility report.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<h5>Techie stuff</h5>
The server was down this weekend so I used this as an excuse to implement some technical tools which will help further down the line. First of all as I mentioned in my last entry I installed MAMP on my development computer. MAMP, stands for Macintosh, Apache, MySQL, PHP (""MAMP"", 2016) and allows to setup a local copy of WordPress on your computer.
I find having access to a local installation to be helpful for two reasons:
<ul>
 	<li>I can work on my child theme tweaks without having access to the server and test them out in a controlled environment.</li>
 	<li>I can test out themes and plugins without muddying my installation. Sometimes everything about a plugin can look good and then you install it and there are things are about it that don't work or the coding isn't up to scratch. So again it is good to have a test environment for that.</li>
</ul>
I also setup a github repository for version control; to track my changes to the theme files. This is the first time that I have setup my own repository, so it was definitely a learning curve for me. However, I think that knowing how to do this will be essential for my forthcoming work on my web portfolio project. Here is my repository for this site: <a href=""https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal"">https://github.com/FionaMacNeill/learningjournal</a> - it seemed like the ideal opportunity to practice using a version control tool. It has been really useful thus far!
<strong>Thinking long and hard about plugin installation is a good idea...</strong>
I was right to spend time deliberating about the types of plugin to install. The problem with plugins is that you often have to spend time tweaking them for every update and every theme. My carefully considered decision to install the footnotes plugin has already had to result in CSS tweaks&lt;fn&gt;Why not use a footnote to explain what I did! I changed .footnote_plugin_text to change the width of the area where the footnotes are shown and the font size. I also had to make the table border elements transparent in the .footnote_plugin_link, .footnote_plugin_index. Finally I needed to manually change the position of the superscript figures as I wasn't happy with the distance of the figure numbers from the text characters, for this I changed the .footnote_plugin_tooltip_text class&lt;/fn&gt; due to how the footnotes were shown in the twentysixteen theme.

1043,1,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,"""Hello world!"" a phrase that has been used to announce the existence of many a computer programme and blog post entry. Taking a few minutes to look into the phrase's history today, it's origins branch back to the early 1970s and the development of the programming language C at Bell Laboratories&lt;fn&gt;There are differing opinions on the exact origins, but it was a nice introduction to developer commentary and critique on Stack Overflow!&lt;/fn&gt; (Herbert, 2016). This sentiment of harking back to computing history seems very appropriate as I embark on the IDM18 Web Development module and reflect on my own historical coding experience.<!--more-->
Although I have web development experience I am largely self-trained. Like many, I have learned as I have gone along and to be able to take this time to create something, in a methodical way from the ground-up is an opportunity that I relish! Thinking back to my most recent ventures into creating code and applications from scratch, the creative coding that I did in Processing (Fry &amp; Reas, 2016)&lt;fn&gt;
Here are some Processing sketch examples of mine in case you are interested, they are bit dated now being from 2013/14 time.
<ul>
 	<li>Bacteria Sketch (captured as a video of the application): <a href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/bacteria-sketch-2014/"">http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/bacteria-sketch-2014/</a></li>

 	<li>Dyslexic Irlen - reading simulator: <a href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"">http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/</a></li>
</ul>
&lt;/fn&gt; has been the closest I've come. It is time to up-the-ante and I want to create something that truly showcases my skills but also some of my current research interests. Ultimately this will manifest as a series of web pages, but I would like to push myself outside of my comfort zone. I will write more about my project idea here, once I have mapped it out a bit more.
<h3>How this journal will work</h3>
The posts in this journal will follow two reflective threads as I work through the module. The first thread is the development of this journal site, based on an independent install of the WordPress Content Management System or CMS (2016). I will outline my thinking behind decisions that I have take related to customisation and in particular accessibility and mobile responsiveness. These are the two key areas that I would like to learn more about during the module.
The second thread is related to the creation of my portfolio website. This part of the coursework will be coded from scratch and needs to rich in features, structurally sound and accessible. More on this in a future post.
<h3 id=""first"">First thoughts related to this journal site</h3>
It is important to me that this journal's theme is as accessible as possible, based on the WordPress theme templates available. At some point down the line I may even create a child-theme in order to customise it to the necessary level. For this reason I need to spend a bit of time checking the coding integrity of some of the themes that I have installed to ensure that they are suitable for customisation.
I have installed a list of themes filtered for accessibility features. Please bear with me, as in these early days, it is likely that this site might change it's skin a couple of times while I decide on a suitable theme. I will also conduct some more thorough investigations using a local copy of Wordpress and themes in MAMP (appsolute GmbH, 2016).
<h3>Provisional List of Themes for Testing:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/afterlight/"">afterlight (Automattic, 2015)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/search/chuchadon/"">chuchadon (Keijonen, 2016a)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/e-nigma-2015/"">e-nigma (Lüken, 2015)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/kuorinka/"">kuorinka (Keijonen, 2016b)</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/"">twentyfifteen (WordPress.org, 2016b)</a>, <a href=""https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/"">twentysixteen (WordPress.org, 2016b)</a> (these are default bundled themes, but I have found them to be very robust as the basis for child themes in the past and also as of March (Rietveld, 2016) they must be WCAG 2 AA compliant).</li>
</ul>
In addition, I shall run some accessibility tests on the best candidate themes using the IDI Web Accessibility checker (AChecker, 2011). As well as referring to one of my favourite sources, the BBC's Future Media Standards and Guidelines to inform design decisions (BBC, 2008). The WordPress accessibility handbook is also an excellent resource (WordPress.org, 2014).
<h3>And finally...</h3>
I have chosen to install one plugin thus far. After drafting this post and realising that I have a persistent need to include asides in my reflections, I felt that having a footnote tool was essential. Yes, it is isn't strictly allowed in APA 6th Edition (Hume-Pratuch, 2014) but, this IS a journal rather than an essay so I think it is okay. I looked through the options and naturally chose the most frequently updated plugin with the most positive reviews. I was also looking at the plugin developers (Herndler &amp; Cheret, 2016a) to make sure that they had a good track record and a well maintained changelog. The developers are also using a Subversion Repository for version control (Herndler &amp; Cheret, 2016b). Based on experience I know that none of these things mean that a plugin will stand the test of time, with frequent and necessary WordPress security updates and such, however based on my assessment is seems like a robust option for the time-being.

Based on my research studying app-to-device relationships in Internet of Things systems (e.g. Fitbit, Jawbone UP, Nest, SmartThings, Glooko), I have uncovered some best practice recommendations when it comes to inspiring trust within your interface.
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Trust definitions used in this video are from Pavlidis, Islam, Mouratidis, and Kearney (2014).</span>
This research is aligned with the SenSe research Cluster at the University of Brighton (secure and dependable software systems).
<strong>About SenSe</strong>
The SenSe cluster aims to develop novel and pragmatic ways to assure the dependability of software systems with particular emphasis on security, trust and risk. We focus on theories from model-based engineering and analysis-based assurance to develop methods, models, practices and tools that promote the provision of security and dependability in complex interconnected and heterogeneous systems and information infrastructures that underpin our economy and society.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Preliminary recommendations: </strong>UX Questions to Ask in Relation to IoT Apps
</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>#</td>
<td>Category</td>
<td>Questions to ask</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong>System dialogues and Semantics</strong></td>
<td>Are system dialogues consistent?
<ul>
	<li>For data permissions</li>
	<li>for use tips</li>
	<li>for motivational messages</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><strong>Settings</strong></td>
<td>
Are all the settings housed together?
Are items like the privacy policy and standards adherence available from this area?
Can the Terms of Service (or a shortened format of ToSs) be accessed from within the app?
Can connected apps and devices be reviewed/managed from within the app?
Can support documentation be accessed from within the app?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><strong>Checkups for Setup/Workflow/Privacy
</strong>An essential part of onboarding. Also a method for supporting trust and helping users to invest time in learning the higher-level functions of an app, which promotes realisation of app benefits and long-term commitment to use of the app (Brignull, 2013).<strong>
</strong></td>
<td><strong>Periodic reminders about setup:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Can the setup be improved?</li>
	<li>What devices could be added safely?</li>
	<li>What benefits might be available as part of the system that the user may be unaware of?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Periodic review of workflow:
</strong>ask users to review the workflow in the system to add a level of human oversight. If the app is not accessed frequently then email and text message may be effective ways to prompt engagement. Think of it like entering a monthly gas meter reading. <strong>
</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Is an automated workflow still operating as intended?</li>
	<li>Is the function still needed?</li>
</ul>
A possible incentive could be that the workflow will stop/timeout if it is not reviewed a la IFTTT.<strong>
</strong>
<strong>Periodic review of p</strong><strong>rivacy:
</strong>privacy overview and audit tools within the app.
<ul>
	<li>What information is shared with third-party developers?</li>
	<li>For what purpose/s is it shared?</li>
</ul>
Non-legalese overview of changes to T&amp;Cs should be included in privacy checks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><strong>Role/function of the app
</strong>Applies to central app and third-party apps.</td>
<td>
This sounds really obvious, but a lot of primary IoT apps don't actually explain their purpose within the system.
What service does the app offer?
What need does the app fulfill?
What does the app do?
How important is the app to the operation of the system? E.g. is it the primary interface or management tool for the system?
What data does it need? - Make it clear what is used and why, in plain English.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><strong>Health/status of hub/sensor/device
</strong>At any point in time the user should be able to view a basic log of what is currently going on in the system.<strong>
</strong></td>
<td>
What is going on in the system right now?
Is recent system activity accessible?
Is it possible to access logs from other time periods?
Is it possible to see what communication channels are in operation?
What third-party apps are connected to the system, what are they doing?
What third-party devices are connected to the system, what are they doing?
This should be more like what you expect from your banking app when it comes to overseeing the operation of high-importance health, home/business automation IoT systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td><strong>OAUTH and API: secondary app data use</strong></td>
<td>
Respect users and prove that your app is more trustworthy by only calling data that you are actually using.
What data is needed into order to provide the desired third-party service?
How is the data used to provide the service?
<strong>Note:</strong> platform manufacturers/developers need to ensure that third-party apps aren't over-privileged in terms of the data they access and the calls they can make via APIs (See the work of  Fernandes, Jung and Prakesh, 2016). Developers need to state their intention when it comes to use of information that they call via the API. This doesn't stop those with malicious intent, but it helps users to distinguish between those who pay due diligence to privacy and those who are either malicious or sloppy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td> <strong>What is shared?
</strong></td>
<td>
Can data access be allowed/disallowed?
Once disallowed from the primary app, is this decision upheld?
<strong>Ideal world:</strong> provide granular options for allowing/disallowing access to data which is not necessary for the operation of the service offered by the app. Better yet, don't ask for the data at all if it isn't essential to operation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td><strong>Access control</strong></td>
<td>
Is two-step authentication an option for the web app and login from a new device?
Does the smartphone/tablet app offer biometric authentication?
Does the app offer the option of setting a passcode for auto screen lock?
Particularly if the app controls home appliances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td><strong>Dependency and operational relationship</strong></td>
<td>
As systems become more complicated it is crucial that the user is aided in building a mental picture of the basic configuration of the system. I keep thinking of Max when I think of this: <a href=""https://cycling74.com/products/max/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://cycling74.com/products/max/</a>
Is logging available?
What is going on in the system right now?
What is attached to this system (devices/sensors/users)?
Is the system visualised in any way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td><strong>Try before you buy</strong></td>
<td>
Wearables have the right idea on this one, allowing you to trial a wearable companion app using your smartphone's built-in sensors. What if you could try out the perks of the system before you buy the actual device?
Is a preview of how the app will operate with devices, provided as part of onboarding?
Can you try of some of the functionality of the system without buying a system-specific device?</td>
</tr>

I am helping to organise a conference later on this month as part of my work on the UCISA Digital Capabilities group. The event is called the Spotlight on Digital Capabilities (May 25/26) and just to let you know, if you find this post particularly riveting there are still spots to attend! You can learn about the event <a href=""http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/groups/dsdg/Events/2016/digcaps.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>, and book to attend at the UCISA site here: <a href=""http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/groups/dsdg/Events/2016/digcaps/booking.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/groups/dsdg/Events/2016/digcaps/booking.aspx</a>
You may also recall <a href=""https://blog.rise.global/category/event-tech-2/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">my guest post on the Rise blog</a> about the gamification of last year's UCISA conference (as well as my <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/06/03/attempting-to-live-blog-while-running-a-twitter-competition/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">frantic live blogging during the event</a>). Well I am more actively involved in designing the gamification of <em>Spotlight </em>this year, so there will be more on that soon too!
One of the things that I am most looking forward to, as part of the <em>Spotlight </em>conference is a live debate that will take on the question: <em>Do we still need IT training teams?</em> This session will take the format of a town-hall forum style debate and will have a panel who explore different views on the topic as well as leading audience discussion. Part of the inspiration for the debate came from my experience attending New Media Consortium conferences from 2010-12 in the US. I remember the sheer energy of the townhall meeting events and the brilliant live drawing visualisations of the discussion, supplied by Rachel Smith. So with this in mind we are working with Brighton artist, Eve Turner-Lee to consider the best ways of visualising our discussion!
Back in March, Eve, my colleague Tucker and I met up to test out the best ways of visualising drawing. Our criteria were that whichever solution we ended up with would need to capture the drawing live and provide a video feed to the projection system somehow so that attendees could watch on screen. A bonus would be if attendees could also watch live from their own smartphones, tablets or laptops.
Here are the results of our investigations. Although Eve put it much more succinctly in her comic strip embedded at the top of this post!
<h2><strong>Option 1: Eve drawing on paper with live video capture
</strong></h2>
[caption id=""attachment_603"" align=""alignnone"" width=""157""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/boardonly-14yj2yk.png"" rel=""attachment wp-att-603""><img class=""size-full wp-image-603"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/boardonly-14yj2yk.png"" alt=""Drawing with pens"" width=""157"" height=""196"" /></a> Trying out drawing with pens on a standing whiteboard[/caption]
&nbsp;
<strong>Proposed scenario:</strong> Eve would draw on paper while wearing an iPhone camera harness or a <a href=""https://gopro.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GoPro camera</a> to video-capture her work live on paper using <a href=""https://www.periscope.tv/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Periscope app</a> (some. Fiona simulated this <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01EUAH7UQ"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01EUAH7UQ</a>) by recording with the Periscope app on iPhone. A computer connected via adaptor to the conference projection system could display the action from Periscope. Audience members could choose to watch from their own devices for a closer view via the Periscope app.
Here is a short video excerpt of one of our live recordings through periscope.
<iframe src=""https://mediastream.brighton.ac.uk/player?autostart=y&amp;fullscreen=y&amp;width=320&amp;height=260&amp;videoId=3394&amp;quality=hi&amp;captions=n&amp;chapterId=83"" width=""330"" height=""270"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Pros</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>People can watch the drawing from their personal devices</li>
	<li>Eve could wear the phone on a chest mount and that could capture the drawing well</li>
	<li>Get lots of attention - broadcast and promote the conference</li>
	<li>Nice Twitter tie-in</li>
</ul>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Cons</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>Can’t turn off the microphone - everyone would have to turn off their devices.
<ul>
	<li>tried covering the microphone</li>
	<li>tried external mic on mute</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Only have portrait orientation</li>
	<li>The quality of the video is not great</li>
	<li>Hard to get a good filming angle at the right difference to show how the drawing will take shape.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Verdict:</strong> Do not use. Although we could turn the sound off from the projection system feed, that does not stop the mic in Periscope from picking up sound. This could result in a veritable cacophony if everyone in the room, decided to watch on Periscope via their mobile devices.
<h2><strong>Option 2: Eve drawing on iPad Pro</strong></h2>

<strong>Proposed scenario:</strong> Eve draws on the iPad Pro using an app like Tayasui Sketches (<a href=""http://tayasui.com/sketches/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://tayasui.com/sketches/</a>) the iPad is mirrored to Fiona's Mac laptop (using <a href=""http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Reflector 2</a>) which is then connected to the projection system via adaptor (VGA or HDMI). For the sharing to mobile devices, we tried a live Google Hangout broadcast which was simulcast to YouTube.
Something to note is that the Refector 2 the software which allows your laptop to broadcast the screen of an iDevice (or an android, via Chromecast technology) features the option to include an iPad visual frame in the video. We have decided to include this on the day, as it will put the origin of the drawing into context.
From the laptop we shared the screen via a Live broadcast Google Hangout and YouTube
* Video from the YouTube broadcast: <a href=""https://youtu.be/RC20gb08vDM"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://youtu.be/RC20gb08vDM</a>
Not only is the video great quality, but the settings in Google Hangouts were fantastic and we were able to turn any potential microphone sound off.
<strong>Verdict:</strong> Use this! Always make sure that
<strong>Setup:</strong>
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Connect Fiona’s laptop to the projection system</li>
	<li>Make sure that the laptop and the iPad Pro are on the same Wi-Fi network</li>
	<li>Mirror the iPad to Reflector 2 software on the laptop</li>
	<li>Start recording the iPad in Reflector 2 so that you have a backup</li>
	<li>Launch Google Hangout on air and tweet link to live YouTube channel and hangout</li>
	<li>Make sure that hangout is set to mute audio and video of attendees (cameraman settings)</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<strong>Video summary of the workflow:</strong>

<h2><strong>Option 3: Eve drawing on paper on the document visualiser/document camera</strong></h2>
<strong>Verdict:</strong> Do not use - Too old-school! Just paled in comparison to option 2!
<h1>Final verdict: iPad Pro &gt; Laptop running Reflector 2 &gt; to projection System &gt; whilst running google hangout broadcasting to youtube</h1>

<strong>Session description:</strong>
Does your app rely on OAuth to offer connection to other apps and services? Based on my research studying app-to-device relationships in Internet of Things systems (e.g. Fitbit, Jawbone UP, Nest, SmartThings, Glooko), I have uncovered some best practice recommendations when it comes to inspiring trust within your interface.

1048,1,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,"The title of this blog post is a nod in the direction of <a title=""Gary Numan in 1979"" href=""https://youtu.be/ZF4Z6smOrZw"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mr. Gary Numan</a>. It felt like the right time to get some simple mock-ups ready in Adobe Fireworks; thus we became electric and moved away from paper, but only temporarily as this will speedup some of the low-fi paper prototypes that I plan later on. Fireworks seemed like the best choice as it is javascript-centric and I think that in all likelihood the final product would be coded in <a title=""Bootstrap main site"" href=""http://getbootstrap.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bootstrap JS</a> (but that would be up to my hypothetical developer).
This is going to be a very long journal entry as there were a lot of decisions involved in taking the jump to the new format. Bear with me.
So first on my list, although I did it second (as I 'think' <em>in colour</em>) was to create a flexible frame-based mock-up of a topic page where learning content would be delivered. The frame size is set to 805 X 604 as this is the size of the window typically specified by <a title=""Xerte webpage"" href=""https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/xerte/index.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Xerte</a>, the University of Nottingham's Learning Object creation tool. The specific Xerte example that I drew inspiration from can be found at the following link: <a title=""Xerte online toolkit example"" href=""http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/toolkits/play_8203"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/toolkits/play_8203</a>. You will see that my progression buttons at the bottom of the page bears some resemblance to theirs, as I felt that it was an elegant solution to the problem in both a browser window and on a mobile device. I would be sure to cite this in my final code! However, I do think that a bit of polishing is needed and possibly an alternative for testing purposes; I think that the ""2 / 4"" looks like a button too, which could lead to confusion, so that is something to fix.

<strong>Several key decisions have gone into the wireframes:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I decided to use icons in order to minimise the size of side tabs (rather than text alone). I did not take this decision lightly as icons can be problematic due to individual interpretation. I looked through a cross section of modern icon collections online and I felt that the icons shown above were modern and appropriate for the user group of the learning object. The <em>Index </em>and <em>Save</em> icons are directly from the collection, <em>Glossary/Help </em>button is my own unique icon taking some inspiration from the icon set. I found the icon set at, <a title=""http://ewebdesign.com/"" href=""http://ewebdesign.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://ewebdesign.com/</a> (<a title=""direct link to source"" href=""http://ewebdesign.com/web-outline-icons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">direct link to page</a>). The icon set is originally from <a title=""http://dryicons.com"" href=""http://dryicons.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://dryicons.com</a> and licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 unported license (<a title=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"" href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>*), so the source of these icons would need to be cited in the code and site attributions. However at this point in the design process they are really just placeholders pending the decision of the Graphic Designer on the eventual (hypothetical) design team. I did try out an alternative save button from the icon set, just to test. However it did not work as well as the conventional floppy disk icon as shown below.

	<li>The <em>cog</em> on the bottom left, as a button to access settings <em>feels</em> correct in terms of positioning and I think that it stands out as an interactive tool without adding too much distraction to the learning environment. This cog is my own Adobe Illustrator drawing based on a cog designed by <a title=""http://www.gentleface.com"" href=""http://www.gentleface.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.gentleface.com</a> under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 unported license (<a title=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"" href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/</a> - as this is student work I am definitely not getting any commercial gain from this). I found the cog at iconfinder.com (<a title=""iconfinder direct source link"" href=""https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/42195/cog_icon#size=48"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">direct link to page</a>). The positioning and style of the cog was a result of my earlier on-paper sketching, so I feel that, that process was particularly valuable.</li>
	<li>Revisiting the wireframe above it seems that the audio mute button might want to be bigger in order to be more symmetrical with the settings button. I liberated the audio from the ""settings"" area; I have yet to fully define how the settings area will look. I did this because if an end-user were accessing the Learning Object from a mobile device they would want the default to be mute and then they could choose to turn on the audio narrative if they had headphones plugged into their device. Based on this I felt that making the audio settings more present and clickable/tapable would benefit, both users on desktop computers in office environments where computer noise might not be preferable and those on mobile devices.</li>

*A closer inspection of the web site's terms showed that the icons cannot be transformed in any way and have to be used as-is. The colour is inverted but other than that there are no structural changes. This suggests that these icons will need to be replaced in the final version of the site.

As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, I started with colour prototypes. The colour scheme was loosely inspired by the University of Exeter's blue, as outlined in their <a title=""University of Exeter visual identity"" href=""http://www.exeter.ac.uk/designstudio/visualidentity/thelogo/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">visual identity guidelines</a> although the branding for university-x needs a bit more thought.

As part of the accessibility settings it is necessary for the user to be able to change the font in the interface. I tried a few experiments to see how this would look, as different fonts take up differing amounts of space on the page. It would also be necessary to provide a contextual preview of these settings as users altered them, so they could see how the fonts and other adjustments would manifest.
I chose the fonts very carefully as although it would be great to offer a font like <span style=""font-family: verdana,geneva;"">Verdana</span> as a legible sans-serif, particularly because it distinguishes letters which often get confused ""I"" and ""L"", there are some font licensing considerations to bear in mind. I liked the example provided by the WebAIM accessibility website (<a title=""http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/"" href=""http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/</a>) where they use the word ""<em>Illustration""</em> to show the legibility difference between Arial and Verdana: e.g. in <span style=""font-family: verdana,geneva;"">Verdana: Illustration </span>and <span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Arial: Illustration</span>. I have included this word in my examples below to help show differences between the fonts. With regard the licensing issue mentioned above, as the ethos of this learning object is open source and having checked font distribution licensing for Verdana, Arial and others and finding that they were not ideal, I sought open source alternatives. Examples and annotation is provided below. It is also important the the selected fonts provide language support for translation engine purposes.
Font 1, the default, is PT Sans (shown in all visual examples above) a family licensed by the ParaType Ltd foundry: <a title=""http://www.paratype.com/public/pt_openlicense_eng.asp"" href=""http://www.paratype.com/public/pt_openlicense_eng.asp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.paratype.com/public/pt_openlicense_eng.asp</a>

Comments: this font uses height to differentiate, <em>I </em>and <em>L. </em>It features more curves than some of the other fonts, and doesn't have a lot of white space, so although it is condensed it might be better for some dylexic readers as this will limit the ghosting effect.

<strong>Fonts that I decided against and size decision</strong>
I took a look at some Google fonts, but felt that they did not fit the licensing needs as well as the SIL OFL fonts. Here are some of the fonts that I reviewed: <a href=""https://www.google.com/fonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:PT+Sans|Roboto|Tenor+Sans"">https://www.google.com/fonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:PT+Sans|Roboto|Tenor+Sans</a>
I also looked at an open font called Gen (<a title=""https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/gen-light"" href=""https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/gen-light"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/gen-light</a>) however when I looked at the work <em>Illustration</em> there was no differentiation between <em>L </em>and <em>I</em>.
In terms of the default size, I decided on 12pt based on some of the guidance included in the Web Style Guide 3rd addition. Specifically the ""Type Sizes for Comfortable Reading"" section: <a title=""http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/8-typography/4a-type-size-legibility.html"" href=""http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/8-typography/4a-type-size-legibility.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/8-typography/4a-type-size-legibility.html</a>

<strong>Further inspiration</strong>
In terms of further development of the settings and help/glossary, I found the following blog posts from the Nielsen Norman Group (NNG) to be particularly helpful.
<ul>
	<li><em>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</em>: <a title=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/"" href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/</a>
What not to do!</li>
	<li><em>Pop-ups and Adaptive Help Get a Refresh</em>: <a title=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pop-up-adaptive-help/"" href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pop-up-adaptive-help/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pop-up-adaptive-help/</a>
The example of the Google Play and AdWords help tools could offer an elegant solution for the glossary/help pop-up. Settings may be too involved to be a pop-up, as previously a preview of how the settings adjust the content would be helpful.</li>
	<li>The case against flat design. There are some helpful tips in this blog post about hinting at interactivity:

Notes: the usability.gov website is mentioned (<a title=""http://www.usability.gov"" href=""http://www.usability.gov"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.usability.gov</a>). I particularly like the quick reference tabs on the left of the site, which slide out on hover. Also the type enlargement tool on their site, it is easy to use and very effective. Their page, <a title=""http://www.usability.gov/site-tour.html"" href=""http://www.usability.gov/site-tour.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.usability.gov/site-tour.html</a> which explains the site is really fascinating, in terms of showing the decisions that they made and why. I have also watched their webinar about the revamp of the site, featured on the page above.
Some key questions, funnily enough I keep coming back to these too!

I was, of course working on my Learning Object project during this time (and you thought I was slacking!) however, for the most part I have to admit to reverting to paper reflections for a while, due to sheer convenience. Currently my notes are collectively living on bits of scrap-paper, serviettes/napkins, and evernote entries. I plan to pull them together here over the next few days, a process that I have started with the inclusion of <a title=""Real-time reflection: experience of completing a Learning Object"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/20/real-time-reflection-experience-of-completing-a-learning-object/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">my reflection of using a learning object as an end user</a>, I will include more on that later in the post.
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>First a few relevant reflections from my experience working on 12 Apps of Christmas</strong></span>
After the course we ran a completion survey. Although there is only a small number of responses so far (11 respondents out of 192 course subscribers; survey is open until the end of January), the responses do correlate with some of the observations that I had made. As the course was designed as an opportunity for academic staff, the insights into that population are helpful as I move forward with the Learning Object design, that is geared to the same community.
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><em>Course subscribers really appreciated clear image-based instructions with accompanying step-by-step written annotation.</em></span>
Commentary:
This could inform aspects of user documentation for the Learning Object. Specifically, the idea to include accompanying PDF guides for topics is supported by this anecdotal evidence.
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><em>Four learning activities or exercises is about the right number to minimise time and interest drop-off.</em></span>
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-28-at-14.44.10-21v040u.png""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-470"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-28-at-14.44.10-21v040u.png"" alt=""screenshot of some of the results"" width=""393"" height=""146"" /></a>
Commentary:
We had a structure of 12+ exercises due to the preexisting structure of the 12 apps course, but interest did drop-off sharply after the 4th day (1 exercise per day). However, when considering a learning object this would seem like a pertinent observation. Also the topic of the learning object is probably (lets be honest) less interesting than learning about mobile apps presented with a festive theme.

<em><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Beware of the inverse Field of Dreams (1989) effect...If you build it, they won't necessarily come</span> </em>
Commentary:
Getting as much web traffic as we did took major effort: building and maintaining the blog where we delivered the content; promoting the content via Twitter and keeping to our self-imposed publishing deadlines. In spite of this effort, the traffic dropped off after the 4th day, as documented in the screenshot from the site analytics above. I think that it is important to admit that learning resource content and therefore the Learning Object that I am designing has a very limited shelf-life, both in the sense of consumable shelf-life and continued relevance. This does not undermine the reusable goal of the Learning Object and it's Open Education ethos, but it does mean that it is more of a reusable template as opposed to being completely reusable in and of itself. I think that best way of considering the reuse aspect is that this Learning Object can be reused through a simple hyperlink to it, but is not geared towards being part of a open learning object repository (it would continue to live with the client university, university-x). Furthermore with my learning technologist hat on, driving traffic to the learning object would require a clearly structured publicity plan so that it was viewed as a timely tool in relation to the changes to DSA funding. Finally, this point really speaks to the importance of the delivery environment and how it portrays the importance of the Learning Object. As the Learning Object is academic staff-focused it is not best placed within the Virtual Learning Environment, a more centralised site with a focus on learning and teaching guidance at the fictional client university may be more appropriate. This will help to ensure that our main target audience have ready access and memorable access.
So this is the spot in my thought process where I revised the purpose <strong>sentence</strong> slightly, as it wasn't quite right:
<blockquote>Changes to funding for support of disabled students, necessitates the need to increase academic staff knowledge of best practices involving technology, to help disabled students and to fill areas of deficit created by the reduction of funding.</blockquote>
The act of doing this resulted in a crucial thought:
This Learning Object is to promote awareness of DSA and accessible practices. How on earth did it end up being about Microsoft Word? I realised that by narrowing the scope, as my prior ideas were too expansive for the project prescribed by my instructor, I also undermined the purpose of the Learning Object. However, I was relieved to realise that this was largely a matter of semantics and learning content rather than an issue that would affect the ""structure plane"" (Garrett, 2011) of the Learning Object.
To summarise, the Learning Object will still focus on accessibility in documents but this will be presented alongside information about DSA and increasing awareness of different student needs, so the new provisional title is: <em>Making your documents accessible. </em>The only aspects that still look at software-based techniques are the guidance PDFs and the <em>offline exercise,</em> which are easier for university-x support staff to update independently and then add new versions to the Learning Object's back-end storage. Another thought that I had in relation to this point, is that learning video repositories like Lynda.com might be provided at university-x, so software training in my Learning Object would be a <em>poor relation</em> when compared to the quality of such repositories. Therefore the key features that set the Learning Object apart are the bite-sized and context specific learning topics, the option to complete it anonymously and its enhanced accessibility. The Learning Object may also be more approachable for users who find the vast choice of videos that are available in a service like Lynda.com to be overwhelming as a starting point.
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Other major discoveries</strong></span>
After I undertook my reflection of using a learning object (post: <a title=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/20/real-time-reflection-experience-of-completing-a-learning-object/"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/20/real-time-reflection-experience-of-completing-a-learning-object/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/20/real-time-reflection-experience-of-completing-a-learning-object/</a>), I decided to take a shot at sketching some wireframes based on v5 of my UML model diagram (see this post: <a title=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/</a>). However, as soon as I started to do it my fears were realised and it became clear that I would need to revise the scenarios and then change the UML model diagram accordingly. This was a lot of extra work, but worth doing as it is important to me that I create something that hopefully equals or improves upon existing Learning Objects.
Here is my first shot at sketching around about 20th of December:
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/featuredpost1-2b0dvmx.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-468"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/featuredpost1-2b0dvmx.png"" alt=""wireframe sketches 1"" width=""800"" height=""575"" /></a>
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">As a result of this I decided to:</span>
<ol>
	<li>I removed one of the Topics, <em>Readability. </em>As it would be covered in <em>Fonts &amp; Legibility</em> and was redundant. It would also add to the time that it would take to complete the Learning Object and this cannot exceed 30mins (a usability requirement).</li>
	<li>Removed <em>view feedback</em> from the Topics as feedback is built into the proceedings of a learning activity - previously called <em>Quiz</em> and then later <em>Lesson</em> in the UML iterations.</li>
	<li>Established the use of a learning activity, based ""programmed instruction"" as defined in the IMS Learning Design Specification (2003a, 2003b). This model features questions, presented alongside information; these will take the form of multiple choice questions with built-in feedback. This is based on an established design pattern outlined in the IMS LDS (2003b, Section 4.1, para. 1).</li>
	<li>I have worked on standardising the language within the scenarios and Learning Object in the wake of what I have learned through study of the IMS Design Specification.</li>
	<li>I added a centralised topic index page. I had something like this very early on, but it became clear to me after I worked though a Learning object myself that users need a clear overview of the contents of the learning object from the get-go. This also displays the test and certificate, although not available immediately, to give users an idea of the narrative flow of the proceedings as well as the internal end goal; obtaining the certificate.</li>
	<li>I added a glossary as a global component of the Learning Object. This was based on a needs from the user characteristics that I had not picked up on for users external to university-x. I also felt frustrated by the lack of a glossary when I was using a Learning Object as a user.</li>
	<li>I added settings and help as a global component of the Learning Object. This is based on the ideas from my <a title=""“Bits &amp; Pieces Put Together to Present a Semblance of a Whole”"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/12/06/bits-pieces-put-together-to-present-a-semblance-of-a-whole/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">earlier post</a>, when I felt that use of the accessibility settings needed to be built into the task scenarios.</li>
	<li>Having quizzes for each topic, no longer made sense and as an incentivizing measure I added a central test that becomes available once the three main topics are completed.</li>
	<li>The introduction became a <em>tutorial</em> rather than <em>slides</em>. Slides were too visually prescriptive and I want to provide a step-by-step guide so that users can learn how to use the interface quickly.</li>
	<li>Plus there is the glaringly obvious oversight... in addition to the normal objectives of software this Learning Object requires Learning Outcomes. <strong>This is the reason why I am no longer referring to the Learning Object as LO, as this is a common shortening for Learning Outcomes in educational terminology and may lead to confusion.</strong></li>
	<li>I took out task scenario 2 where the user could return to the saved Learning Object via a hyperlink in an email. This is not great practice as it encourages behaviour on the part of the user that could lead to them becoming victims of phishing in the future (Van Duyne, Landay, &amp; Hong, p.555). The solution is to provide a clear link to a university domain parent page, rather than a user-specific URL and instruct the user to copy and paste the parent URL into the web browser address bar.</li>
</ol>
After all this, I ended up with the following - I feel MUCH more positive about this as the structure makes more sense.

<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>A few notes about IMS LDS </strong></span>
I have mixed feelings about my discovery of the IMS Learning Design Specification. I came across it as I searched the ALT (Association of Learning Technologists) wiki, as I was curious what standards and specifications exist for Learning Technologies as these technologies have been around for a long time. Initially I came across information on Educational Modelling Language, which has folded into the IMS standard (original information from the ALT wiki: <a title=""ALT wiki link"" href=""http://wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/Learning_objects_and_repositories#Systems_and_processes_for_sharing_Learning_Objects"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/Learning_objects_and_repositories#Systems_and_processes_for_sharing_Learning_Objects</a>)
On the one-hand the specifications feature learning design patterns, which are immensely valuable to this project and also within my day job. The specifications also include a very comprehensive outline of the XML metadata requirements that are needed to create a Learning Object that is truly reusable and also searchable; the following article some some good annotation of the XML to demonstrate the metadata properties (Ragbir &amp; Mohan, 2009). However, as a specification it is too complex for this project, so as much as I would like to create a perfect learning object, in order to be compliant with the standard I would need to start from scratch and create something with multiple roles (student and support) and far more complex taxonomies. I also looked into whether I could adapt it and use it as a documentation standard, as a perhaps more appropriate alternative to the NASA documentation standard (1991), however as I started to map the necessary concepts over the contents page and  it became clear that would not be possible within the scope of this project.

It didn't go well (screenshot from 2003a).[/caption]
<span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>So what am I going to use from IMS LDS?</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>I have tried my best to use the language outlined in the IMS LDS as this will provide a common way to describe the processes, architecture and learning design using terminology that is understood in my professional field.</li>
	<li>I will reference some of the learning design patterns (as found in Section 2. Use Cases in 2003b) as they are very helpful and provided some positive validation of the work that I had done so far, in terms of the structural make-up of a Learning Object.</li>
	<li>I absolutely love the stage-play metaphor that the IMS LDS standard uses to explain a learning object. In short a Unit of Learning (UoL), as defined in the standard, is a package that includes the learning content, including code and physical files alongside the specified metadata. This content is ""played"" and is compatible with different delivery ""environments"". The actions or method within the UoL are a series of ""Plays"". Those plays are structured as ""acts"" and within the acts the ""Roles"" perform their requisite ""activities"" within the ""environment"" (2003b, Section 3.2.3). The most succinct description of the standard that I have found is a PowerPoint presentation by researchers from the University of Vienna, Introduction to IMS Learning Design (Derntl, Neumann, &amp; Oberhuemer, 2009).</li>
	<li>Having looked at the NASA software documentation standard (1991) again I felt that an adapted version of the IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications (1998) will actually be more suitable in terms of outlining the final concept document. This standard has more common group with the IMS LDS.</li>
</ul>
As for the ""minor anguish"" of this post's title, as you can tell from the my writing above, discoveries have resulted in substantial work and with limited time available this has certainly led to a certain level of anguish. This was largely due to the need to back-track in certain areas. However, I now feel that I am almost back on-track, with the aim of completing my wireframes before the Christmas holiday is out.

Throughout the process, I considered what went well, what could have worked better and what I felt was missing. This exercise resulted in something of a <em>structural</em> epiphany as I realised that I had missed some vital steps in the conceptual model, this was further borne out when I started my wireframe drawings and found that there were things that simply did not add up. Below is my, step-by-step written account of my experience in the Learning Object, I have highlighted sections of particular significance. My next post will outline some of the decisions that took place from December 16th onward.

	<li>Has a keyboard shortcut clearly defined for navigation through the learning object. The keyboard shortcut is ""c"" this is not the most comfortable key on the keyboard to use. For righthanded people the arrow keys are in a better position. I am interested in why they chose ""c"". I think that spacebar might offer a better experience for right-handed and left-handed people and also has an association with start and stop, due to its use in YouTube and other video streaming services as a start/stop video option.</li>
	<li>Has a menu which persists throughout the LO with settings options clearly visible</li>
	<li>Allows the option to replay each section or skip to the next</li>

<h2>1.1 Purpose</h2>
<strong>The problem (in one sentence):</strong>
Changes to support-related funding for disabled students necessitates the need to increase academic staff knowledge of best practices involving technology to support disabled students.</blockquote>
Well I have been working away on a number of things and they ARE starting to resemble a whole, which is encouraging. For a while there, I felt like I was in a sort of limbo struggling to see the connections between my activities.
I decided to start work on the concept document. I looked at a few different documentation standards, however I finally settled on adapting the NASA software documentation standard(NASA-STD-2100-91, 1991). The activity of starting to pull together some of the project background information, as previously explored on this blog, in-writing has been really helpful. That work is summarised in the <em>problem</em> sentence above. The idea of producing a sentence-long summary is influenced by LEAN principles as applied to UX (Gothelf, 2013, p.20), although not having an original interactive system that I being commissioned to replace it is more about having a succinct statement to sum-up why what I am designing is important.
Furthermore, I decided that it was time to look back through the characteristics, hierarchical task breakdown and task scenarios in order to check for any inconsistencies and as a means to validate aspects of my UML diagram. I identified a number of naming differences that are now revised and standardised conventions have been established across the design artifacts. The main realisation about the hypothetical Learning Object (for university-x; a fictional university) was that for a tool with the primary goal of promoting accessibility, there was no accessibility built into its interaction. Part of offering responsive accessibility options is allowing the user to specify their needs and I realised that this needed to feature in both the tasks and the interaction design for new users entering the Learning Object. This is now included and reflected in the UML diagram below (version 5).
Another realisation, also on the accessibility front, was that I had previously stated that PDF guides would be made available, related to each of the Learning Topic quizzes in the Learning Object. I noticed that I had not included an interaction to allow for the download of 'said' PDFs. Another aspect that was missing, was the gamification element which I had so painstakingly thought about during the characteristics phase. Due to the constraints of the project, these features cannot be sophisticated, however <em>some</em> features should still be there! Namely there was no ending to the learning object and I conceived that staff would be expecting some kind of conclusion, however basic. Therefore I have included a finale, which will feature <em>number of participants per school</em> and <em>school rank</em>. Very basic, but it may motivate users in university-x to encourage colleagues to take part in order to promote their place on this leader board. For non-university-x users then the finale will be a simple ""thank you"" page.
Now I need to get back to the requirements and wireframing, but I had to get that stuff out of the way first. As previously mentioned, I think that I have realised that Learning Objects are fairly hard to design from scratch as there are some built-in expectations about how they work and how users interact with them. On the one hand it is good, as the user knows what they are getting with a leaning object, the same way they do when buying their favourite brand of cereal. On the other it is fairly constraining from a design perspective as it means that there are certain things that need to be included even if they feel redundant (the user marking completion of activities for example; this is pretty essential as it unlocks or allows progression to other areas of the LO, but it feels like it should be automated). Also this activity has really helped me to think about structural aspects of all eLearning systems, which very often seem more like vessels for a collection of functionality rather than unified products. This Learning Object is no different, the illusion of cohesion will be the mission of design; such a large proportion of educating is about design.

I have a confession to make, I am pretty perplexed by Unified Modeling Language (UML). If you were to look at this blog, based on the lack of posts, you wouldn't think that I had made any progress over the past two weeks. We covered User Conceptual Modeling as a topic in class back on the 6th of November and in my last post on the 11th, I made the grand proclamation that I would complete my UML diagram by Friday (13th). Well I did create a UML diagram, and then I created another iteration and another; I became obsessed with understanding the syntax...not a healthy obsession, but a frustrating one.
During the past week I tried to read everything that I could in order to aid my understanding. Tonight I came to the realisation that Learning Objects are pretty hard to build in UML. I also made the decision to leave this part of the project for now and move on to writing some commentary on user requirements. I feel that by moving on, I may miss some error in the system design, but also if I continue to work on the diagram I am going to stall my progress further. This was paralleled early on in the other project that I am working on at the moment, where I attempted to create a diagram for a hypothetical wearable device as part of the Internet of Things. Four-plus iterations later I finally have something that resembles the operation of a real system.
To summarise here is what I have learned from this road-block:
<ul>
	<li>step <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">away</span> from the diagram;</li>
	<li>perspective can only be capitalised upon by making some space between yourself and the problem and then walking back towards it;</li>
	<li>Make like Andy Warhol, and iterate;</li>
	<li>Allow for frustration time - cook on a medium heat and allow to simmer.</li>
</ul>
Until next time...
P.s. I am leaving this note here because these diagrams need a glossary.

1056,1,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,"An eventful week! Upon considering how to best design the Learning Object for a hypothetical client university, I decided to start by looking at the prospective tasks to be completed in the interface (and beyond). I took this route as I was pondering personae and realised that without tasks, in this particular case it felt like a chicken and egg situation. As a result of this process, I now feel more able to come up with robust personae based on each of the groups identified in my <a title=""User characteristics are coming out of my ears"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/10/20/user-characteristics-are-coming-out-of-my-ears/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">earlier post</a> (<a title=""Characteristics for – Users from the client university: academic staff"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/characteristics-for-users-from-the-university-academic-staff/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">academic staff</a>, <a title=""Characteristics for – Users from the client university: students, admin staff, researchers etc."" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/characteristics-for-users-from-the-client-university-students-admin-staff-researchers-etc/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">students/other staff</a>, <a title=""Characteristics for – Users external to the client university"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/characteristics-for-users-external-to-the-client-university/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">external</a> and <a title=""Characteristics for – Support users from the client university"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/characteristics-for-support-users-from-the-client-university/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">support</a>), so I will build those next on pages in this blog.
On a related note, yesterday I attended the first ever Brighton Gamification meet-up. The event had a focus on the use of gaming strategies in sports wearable IoT systems. Bearing in mind that my other project is looking at <em>sports wearable devices </em>and the systems they reside in, this could not have been more apropos!
For full details of the event, including the list of speakers, see the meetup.com page: <a title=""http://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Gamification-Meetup/events/225063072/"" href=""http://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Gamification-Meetup/events/225063072/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Gamification-Meetup/events/225063072/</a>
<h3>Key points and observations from the event</h3>
<strong>Paul Nuki - CEO of</strong> <a title=""StepJockey - how it works"" href=""https://www.stepjockey.com/how-it-works"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">StepJockey (a fitness app)</a>
<ul>
	<li>Recommended the MINDSPACE project as a resource. MINDSPACE was the result of a research project commissioned by the UK government in 2010. It features pragmatic advice about how to implement gamification strategies. As Paul said, some of the recommendations as part of MINDSPACE, seem obvious but they can be very helpful to use as a check-list when working on any gamified project. <a title=""Gamified UK link"" href=""http://www.gamified.uk/2015/04/27/mindspace-influencing-behaviour/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Here is a bit more information</a> about MINDSPACE from the gamified UK site. As a side note, a nice feature of the gamified UK site, is that that they include an estimation of how long it will take to read the post (e.g. ""1 minutes (ish)"" sic). I need to make sure that I include this in my interface design, so that it is clear how long each activity will take.</li>
	<li>If you haven't heard of StepJockey before, check out the signs on the stairs in Watts Building at Moulsecoomb campus; someone has already <a title=""Rate a staircase"" href=""https://www.stepjockey.com/Stairs/Rate/Add"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">rated our staircase</a>. It is such a good idea!</li>
	<li>Another point that Paul made is that when it comes to engaging in corporate wellness programmes and fitness initiatives people are often time poor (don't have time to engage), skills poor (in this instance, not accomplished at a sport, thus climbing stairs, although <a title=""Empire State Building Runup"" href=""http://www.esbnyc.com/event/2015-empire-state-building-run-up-info"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">that can be a sport</a>) or self-conscious. It occurs to me that these same conditions apply to learning about technology and ultimately what is the incentive, as it isn't like you become more svelte as a result of doing it. One to dwell on.</li>
	<li>Paul also suggested some good strategies to deal with awarding prizes. Apparently material prizes work best, but all prizes skew behaviours (brilliantly outlined by Daniel Pink (2010) in his book <em>Drive</em>, which I devoured recently). This will be tricky as material prizes are hard to provide in an academic environment, however I think that random or 'spot prizes' have a lot of potential and could be awarded based on certain types of engagement with the system and delivered via email.</li>
	<li>When I have run gamification activities, there is a tendency for a 'top of the class' factor to emerge. This is when a small group of people, who are highly competitive accrue a large amount of points in a small amount of time leading to the disenfranchisement of other competitors. Paul had some good suggestions to counteract this issue, such as putting these people into their own super leagues (which may not be visible to other users). Also, you can personalise messaging and views of their data, focusing on the positive for users who tend to be less engaged. Furthermore, he suggested rewarding consistency and the idea of making the 'top of the class' players ""champions"" to encourage others. Finally, I will take heed of his advice that small teams work better than big ones, so perhaps my plan of having people contribute to their school score is too abstract. What about a by-campus building score instead?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Toby Beresford - CEO of RISE.global</strong>
<ul>
	<li>I have used the RISE leaderboard tool recently (see <a title=""Re-Blog: Reflections on using Rise to support conference-based gamification"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/10/24/reflections-on-using-rise-to-support-conference-based-gamification/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">blog post</a> for details) and found it to be very helpful in a situation where you want to define your own metrics and create an enticing leaderboard.</li>
	<li>I found Toby's thoughts on the subject of using scoring dashboards particularly insightful. The highlights...
<ul>
	<li>Toby's working definition of dashboards: ""Engaging, actionable feedback that triggers timely, behaviour change.""
<ul>
	<li>So dashboards can be used to:
<ul>
	<li>Learn something new, or</li>
	<li>Get better at something we already do</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>What is the business objective? This is where Toby made an excellent point: managers measure and players/coaches keep score. How can I emphasize this in the design? It is about self-betterment and group-bettement; not keeping tabs on people.</li>
	<li>Reward strategies: as Toby said (and this is another thing that I learned from reading Drive), rewards can turn play into work. So micro rewards are the way to go. Also he showed the example of Nike+ app, which unlike other gamification apps has no rewards or badges; I had never noticed this in the years when I was an avid fan of Nike+!</li>
	<li>Who do I compare myself with? This is a crucial question. I prefer a measure, like a mark, or a grade with clear criteria rather than a straightforward comparison between people. Toby showed a dashboard with a single score and I really like this idea, because I think that it mitigates the possibility of cognitive overload brought on by too may dials/measures/stats.</li>
	<li>Then most importantly, the distribution channels for the dashboard need to be thought through. If people want to share their scores, how do they do that? If people are doing well or need encouragement how do you stimulate engagement so that they come back to the board, or the activity, with which it is associated? The key is multichannel distribution and getting the balance right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hierarchical Task Breakdown: What Fiona did...</h2>
I believe in learning from ones mistakes and so I have kept my initial hierarchical task breakdown below. When I first published this post, I declined to notice that the numbering system of the task list below had not worked properly in the saved version. However upon noticing this and attending class last Friday, I also noticed that I hadn't completed the breakdown correctly and was making this WAY too complicated for myself again! In fact each of the topics listed below would make a good learning object on their lonesome. When I reviewed the user personae that I have created (see a future post) I noticed that the common denominator was that all the users would definitely need to create documents (academic staff, other staff, students, external and even support staff). This helped to re-focus my efforts on the design of a learning object dedicated to creating accessible Word documents. Simple yes, but a nice structured place to start.
-------------What I did--------------
So bearing all of this in mind, I have come up with a task plan below, starting from a future menu page in the learning object. The main question for those who engage is... ""What would you like to learn about first?"".
NB. Steps in <span style=""color: #808080;"">grey</span> occur outside the Learning Object

<h2>What Fiona did next...</h2>
I went back to the drawing board and created the new hierarchical task breakdown below. This is based on Task Scenarios, which I have added to <a title=""Task Scenarios as of 04/11/15"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/task-scenarios-as-of-041115/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this page for reference</a> (although I anticipate further edits of these documents further down the line).

1057,1,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,"This post is another entry related to a hypothetical user interface design as part of my study towards an MSc in User Experience Design. <strong>These blog posts should be viewed as rough and reflective and are concerned with a project for a fictional university</strong>.
The first point to clarify is, what exactly is an Open Educational Resource and why would a potential client want to build one? I personally find the following definition from <a title=""Jisc website"" href=""https://www.jisc.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jisc</a> to be the most helpful:
<blockquote>
<p class=""page-title"">Open educational resources are teaching and learning materials that are freely available online for everyone to use, whether you are an instructor, student or self-learner. Examples of OER include: full courses, course modules, syllabi, lectures, homework assignments, quizzes, lab and classroom activities, pedagogical materials, games, simulations, and many more resources contained in digital media collections from around the world.
Jisc, from ""Open educational resources (OERs)"" (<a title=""OER definition"" href=""https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/open-educational-resources"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">direct link</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""page-title"">So the point is that an OER can be almost anything, what distinguishes it is the fact that it is an openly available resource. In the interest of being more specific, from this point forth I shall refer to what I am designing as a learning object; a self-contained learning exercise, which in this case is delivered online from a designated server space or Learning Object repository. This Learning Object will be a basic web application with a ""choose your own adventure"" type learning exercise based on the creation and format of study materials with some interactive gamification elements thrown in. A lot more thinking and development will be required before we can get to that point.</p>
My imagined client for this project is a UK university (enrollment = 20K+) and the intended audience for the Learning Object are their academic staff. The university would like the Learning Object to be openly accessible as it is a mode of publicity (shared via social networks with university branding) and it shows that the university are forward thinking and considering staff professional development and digital capabilities. As the link to the resource will be openly accessible and find-able via search engines, this means that potential users could be anyone with an interest in the accessible presentation of resources, for example: primary school teachers, lecturers, student support tutors, learning technologists, students in teaching training, etc. Potential users could also be anyone who works with a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) or a Learning Management System (LMS) and there are many flavours VLE/LMS on the market. Furthermore users may also come from anywhere in the world, which means that if I wanted to serve all potential users the Learning Object (LO) would need to be available in multiple languages.
The unique paradigm presented by OERs is explained very nicely via metaphor from Jisc - interestingly Jisc also use the consumer and creator definitions, although I came up my definitions independently and found their page after the fact: https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/open-educational-resources/oer-myths

<h2>Hold-up...this is getting really complicated</h2>
However that is not the model that I am going for in this case, the LO is not meant to be all things, to all people; it is for a very specific purpose and that is to help academic staff at a university in the UK gain awareness of different strategies for making learning materials accessible as a response to the forthcoming <a title=""Changes to DSA"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/higher-education-student-support-changes-to-disabled-students-allowances-dsa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">changes to Disabilities Living Allowance</a>. These changes, planned by the current government will take effect halfway through 2016 and may affect the support provisions available to some students in the UK. This LO serves a specific need, for a specific client so is to a certain extent propriatary, the way that we achieve the ""open"" aspect is make the URL accessible to external users outside the university; use metadata to support search engine optimisation; license the underlying code with a <a title=""GNU General Public License 3 info"" href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GNU General Public License 3</a>; and make the source code available via a repository like <a title=""GNA website"" href=""http://gna.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">gna.org</a> which is hosted in France and supports <a title=""Git Version Control"" href=""http://www.git-scm.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">git version control</a> (to comply with <a title=""EU Safe Habour"" href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34442618"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">EU safe harbour ruling</a>).
<h2>On the topic of technical construction...</h2>
Upon consideration of how the Learning Object will be created, I think that it will be a custom coded html5 site with MySQL backing (this is subject to change). A facet of the brief is that data needs to be entered by the user in some way, web applications like <a title=""Xerte"" href=""http://www.xerte.org.uk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Xerte</a> which allow for the fast creation of html5 Learning Objects are not suitable as the resulting LOs seem to be read-only. So although these LOs can be interactive, no data that is entered is actually collected thus the need for a custom solution rather than using an established LO creator application. As the plan is to make the source code publicly reusable this will need to be considered during the construction process, to ensure that there is sufficient documentation to guide those who may wish to reuse the code.
In this model there are two key user groups:
<ul>
	<li>those users from the university who interact with the LO;</li>
	<li>those users from outside the university who interact with the LO.</li>
</ul>
We also need to consider:
<ul>
	<li>those external users who consume first and then move on to create; as in copy and adapt the LO using the source code. These user-creators fall outside the scope of the design for interaction, but should be considered throughout the design and coding stages to ensure that documentation for the code is sufficient and the design allows for future customisation. For example clear image tags and labeling need to be in place to allow any screenshots taken from Moodle or a different VLE to be substituted for the original screenshots taken from Blackboard (see paragraph below).</li>
</ul>
As I mentioned before there are many different VLEs out there, however as we are talking about the UK (and anyone else is welcome to go to town with the content) then the two most prevalent VLEs in the UK are Blackboard and Moodle (UCISA, 2014, p.10). As a consequence, those users who <em>consume</em> will fall into two camps - those with an interest in Blackboard and those with an interest in Moodle; the principles presented in the Learning Object will be the same for each system but the visual aesthetics differ between the two. My client is a university that uses Blackboard, so the LO will be blackboard focused but we hope that someone will create Moodle and other versions in the future based on our source code.
<hr />
<h2>Friday, 6th of November 2015 - Update:</h2>
I have changed my thinking on the LO, as VLEs are updated fairly often this would limit the shelf-life of the LO. It was also proving to be too complex. So I have decided to focus on the idea that I am building one LO, of a hypothetical many, and the LOs are all about the different kind of materials going into the VLE. The LO I am designing will be about creating accessible documents in Microsoft Word. For more on this, see <a title=""Making a game of task decomposition – just in time for Halloween"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/10/29/making-a-game-of-task-decomposition-just-in-time-for-halloween/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this later post</a>.

<tr>
<td rowspan=""3""><strong>Direct</strong></td>
<td><strong>Users from the university: academic staff</strong></td>
<td>
The design needs to be approachable with goals for the LO clearly outlined. It is quite important that users do not need to login in order to use the LO. A sort of login fatigue is a major issue and some university users may wish to remain anonymous.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;</td>
<td>It would be helpful to track how many academic staff complete the LO, so a potential method for this would be allow the production of a completion certificate at the end of the LO, this will only be generated after the user logs in (using an existing university LDAP easy proxy). Users will have the option to skip the certificate, if they wish to remain anonymous. External users and anon users will still be able to generate a basic completion certificate, but it won't have full university validation (or something along those lines).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Users from the university: students, admin staff, researchers etc.</strong></td>
<td>Although the intended audience are the academic staff at the university and the LO will be clearly labelled as such, other types of university users will not be prevented from accessing the LO.</td>
<td>At the beginning of the LO the users will be asked to type in their role which will auto-populate an entry cell based on a predefined set of options. E.g. What is your role? I am... offer a drop-down list (e.g. a student; a researcher, an administrator etc.) and autocomplete, if ""other"" is selected then they will be asked to specify. In order to gain some basic usage stats, users will be asked to self-identify whether they work/study at the client university (to differentiate between internal and external users). This data will not be completely accurate as people may forget to self-identify or an external user may incorrectly identify, however it will give an indication of use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Users external to the university</strong></td>
<td>External users will have access to the LO. These users could come from anywhere in the world and English may not be their first language.</td>
<td>
As login is not required to use the LO, any entry fields must be validated to ensure that malicious code cannot be entered in the LO.
The option for a basic certificate, where the external users enter their preferred name and a PDF is generated for download needs to be available.
Write the LO in <a title=""plain english campaign"" href=""http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">plain English</a>, this will help all users.
Where specific technical terms are used, provide a glossary and/or rollover definitions as technical terms differ per country.</td>

<td>These are users who access the derivative versions of the LO.</td>
<td>The experience of these users is, to a certain extent beyond our control. However the development documentation should recommend best practices for accessibility.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Remote</strong></td>
<td>Technologist/s responsible for monitoring the use of the LO needs a way to download usage data. These users are also support users.</td>
<td>Require access to a basic online dashboard showing how many academic staff per department/school have completed the LO. Counts of other users should also be included in the dashboard and an option to download the data as a .csv.</td>
<td>
It would be ideal for this data to be displayed as a leader board; a graph showing the top school through to the bottom school. However this is really out-of-scope, as that is a separate application. It would be nice to show users school stats after they have logged in for their certificate. E.g. you are 1 of 48 people in Computing who have completed the LO. Computing is now the 2nd most engaged school. However if robust .csv export features are added visualisations could be produced periodically in Excel and other programs and the leader board could be added at a later stage.
Any more complex anonymous data about visitors to the LO should be reviewed through Google Analytics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Collateral</strong></td>
<td>Those accessing derivative versions of the LO via  third-party repositories.</td>
<td>
The LO may loose some value in its iterations and therefore when it is placed in repositories by third-parties, the owners of these repositories may not want it to be there.
The client university's branding graphics will not be included with the source code, as it needs to be clear that derivatives are not still owned/maintained by the university.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Prohibited</strong></td>
<td>Someone who wishes to inject malicious code into the LO in order to target users.</td>
<td>
Validate all data entered into the LO according to set parameters; disallow html tags and certain words/characters.
There is little that the university can do to prevent this in the derivative versions of the LO, but a disclaimer should be included in the source code stating that the LO should only be used when delivered/served by reputable providers.</td>

This knowledge and level of access will also be shared with employees of the university. They require documentation/training prior to providing access.

In early June I had the pleasure of implementing a conference-wide gamification activity in support of the <a href=""http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/groups/dsdg/Events/2015/digcaps.aspx"">UCISA Digital Capabilities</a> event. The event took place at MediaCity, Salford; a vibrant and engaging venue for an event stocked-full of innovative ideas. The event focused on showcasing successful practices for supporting academic staff and learners in their use of technology within further and higher education. Another goal of the event was to highlight findings from the recent <a href=""http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/%7E/media/groups/dsdg/usg/Digital_Capabilities_Executive_Summaryv6.ashx"">Digital Capabilities survey</a>. So when a member of the event organising committee, Iain Cameron (University of Aberdeen, and UCISA Digital Capabilities committee), mentioned the idea of a Twitter selfie (or Twelfie) competition as part of the proceedings; Rise immediately came to my mind as the right tool for the job! I had encountered Rise before at a demo at the International Confex event in 2013 and then again during the Mahara 2014 Hui held at the University of Brighton.

1059,1,17/05/2020 20:33,17/05/2020 20:33,"So to recap, my quest for last week was to look at the following and comment. I did look at the <em>following</em> but this is the first chance that I have had to comment as I have been deeply ensconced in putting some of what I have learned into practice within my IoT research project (sorry, I'm deliberately not providing a lot of detail on the IoT project, just reflecting on what I have learned).
&lt;----the folllowing---!&gt;
<em>- Read and think about <strong>BS EN ISO 9241-210-2010 – Ergonomics of human-system interaction </strong></em>(ISO, 2010).<em>
</em>
<ul>
	<li>I suspect that I shall mainly use the ISO 9241 document as a reference tool. The document itself, in a way, takes the form of several checklists. I particularly like the way that design principles are so neatly summed-up as a helpful list on page 14! The pragmatic advice offered in relation to sources that designers might investigate, when direct contact with users is not possible (pages 16-17), has also been helpful for the IoT project where working with users falls outside the scope. The same will be true of this project, so I really need to get into the mind of my potential users!</li>
</ul>
<em>- Read and comment on user profiles and personae or personas</em>
<ul>
	<li>Since last week I have created 5 draft personas and have started to flesh out three proto personas. The preparatory process of sifting through the user characteristics is time consuming, but it truly does mean that you are covering almost every angle and gaining valuable domain knowledge in the process. My next task is to come up with personas for this project! Which I shall start on in my next post (in draft phase at the moment).</li>
</ul>
<em>- Read and comment on Scenarios</em>
<ul>
	<li>I actually jumped the gun with this one a bit as it is this week's reading (not last weeks). However, I have already been starting to create scenarios for my IoT personas and I am hoping to refine them based on some of the further reading that I do this week on the topic. I found the distinctions made by Lauesen (2005) to be helpful, when considering tasks and scenarios. For example Lauesen (2005) offers the analogy of a hotel; the act of checking in is a ""general case"" as that could apply to any guest; the personification of the act where a named persona checks into a numbers room is a ""case scenario"" and a story which encapsulates both these factors in a real-life situation is a ""vivid scenario"" (p.162). This book is written from a software engineering viewpoint, which may mean that it does not apply in all situations. In the UX Book (2012) I feel like I may have found a new mantra to repeat to myself...""Did it all seem too easy? Did the story seem a little too perfect?"" (p.266).</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Project plan Idea</h2>
One of my tasks for the second session was to come up with a project idea for the module. I have decided to that my project will focus on designing interaction for an Open Educational Resource (OER) in honour of <a title=""Open access week"" href=""http://www.openaccessweek.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Open Access Week</a>, taking place this week (19-25th) Internationally.
My OER will be a self-guided web application for academic staff. The application will take a tour of a typical Blackboard or Moodle course/module and explain how to make study materials as accessible as possible and how to signpost materials to students. The activity will include some quizzing and sorting elements and will focus on presentation and structural considerations. I also think that it would be immensely helpful to simulate how text and colours are seen by say dyslexics or those who are colour blind. I have experimented with this in some of my own programming in the past and it really helped to promote better understanding. Here is my attempt at programming my own dyslexic reading patterns for reference: <a title=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/</a>
If you are interested in seeing some examples of how this might look in the end, here are some of my favourites - although I should say that this project is more of a planning exercise, so it may only ever exist in prototype form.

Thus far our leaderboard (courtesy of Rise) is looking healthy, having cleared out the scores from the pre-conference tweets (pre 4:00am today that is) and re-started our polls. All of our photo scores are retained, but that still gives folks a time to catchup.
We have been tweaking our scoring strategies this morning and then I look forward to attending the sessions this afternoon. A few things that I have learned about using a Leaderboard so far...
<ol>
	<li>Adding players via the Twitter tag poll is not the most efficient practice. So I have added people manually and we encouraged players to add themselves.</li>
	<li>Managing the scores via Google doc with the excellent Samantha Ahern is a very good plan. We are each taking a couple of metrics each (selfies with celebrities, etc.).</li>
	<li>Polling tweets with the hashtag is however excellent and is working really well.</li>

<h2>Sarah Davies from JISC - Chair and Introduction
Spotlight on digital Capabilities event</h2>
#udigcap
<h2>Presentation:
Technology and innovation at the university of Winchester</h2>
<h3>Talking about Digital Literacy at University of Winchester.</h3>
Rebecca JS Nice - a student talking about her experience. Multi-disciplinary degree in Dance and History.
Student Identity and Expectations
- Didn't find much of an outlet to use her iPad in class when she arrived at Uni
- Use of technology was inconsistent
Digital Experience at Winchester - Rebecca became a student fellow.
Student Fellow: an honary-based scheme.
Rebecca became part oar the Mobile Device Scheme
<ul>
	<li>The students were set the task of researching apps and use of mobile technologies in order support instructors who were provided with devices.</li>
	<li>Enjoyed the responsibility of undertaking the research</li>
	<li>The students have an active blog, here it is: <a title=""https://uowmobiledevicescheme.wordpress.com/"" href=""https://uowmobiledevicescheme.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://uowmobiledevicescheme.wordpress.com/</a></li>
	<li>Biggest barrier? Using imagination and motivation, looking at lesson plans and considering ways of using devices</li>
	<li>There were some attitudinal barriers amongst academic staff - worried that devices will be misused. Point is that is you bring the devices into the scope of the class then that is a way of monitoring them and ensuring that they are used to support learning.</li>
	<li>Rebecca has built a website to build an online identity - taking what she is learning on the Mobile Device Scheme and using it support her studies. Here is her site: <a title=""http://www.rebeccajsnice.com/"" href=""http://www.rebeccajsnice.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.rebeccajsnice.com/</a></li>
	<li>She has used blogs to support instructors - used Tumbr as a presentation tool. Asked class and instructors to look her Tumbr during the presentation, linked Tumbr through to Pinterest for added value as part of the project
<ul>
	<li>This was considered a massive risk - so although encouraged - there was concern. Worried about cognitive overload.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Student Barriers?
<ul>
	<li>Confidence - what happens when things go wrong. Consider coping strategies when working with technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Teachers are enthusiastic about the Mobile Device Scheme, but are unsure of how to implement it within their own teaching.
<ul>
	<li>In support of job applications - need to be better links with industry. There should not be technology-based surprises when entering the workforce after studying on a degree
<ul>
	<li>How can we diagnose what employers are looking for and empower our students with career appropriate training?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Amy Barlow - Staff Support perspective - University of Winchester</li>
	<li>Understanding the digital needs of students
<ul>
	<li>Staff have found that the student fellows are really approachable.</li>
	<li>Good point: this generation of students are used to demonstrating/showing technology to their parents and grandparents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Outcomes:
<ul>
	<li>60 student fellow projects per year</li>
	<li>Partnership project on mobile device use across disciplines</li>
	<li>A few example projects
<ul>
	<li>English students introdcue video summaries of modules by tutors to aid module selection</li>
	<li>Law students run peer feedback activity through filming each other in Mock Court Trials</li>
	<li>History students evaluate the use of formative audio feedback</li>
	<li>Student representatives evaluate the use of social media for communcation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Rebecca's recommendations:
<ul>

The Digital Student - Research
<ul>
	<li>Stakeholder consultations
<ul>
	<li>7 challenge areas</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>School focused study - students take expectations from school into their expectations into HE.
<ul>
	<li>Self-directed learning with technology wasn't expected, even if they were using tech outside of school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Ongoing FE and Skills study</li>
</ul>
The Digital Student - Outcomes (resources you can use)
<ul>
	<li>50 institutional exemplars (based round the 7 challenge areas)</li>

</ul>
<h3>The 7 Challenge Areas</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There are case studies for each of the areas identified. Dave makes the point that you can build a framework, but what does that look like in terms of small meaningful changes.
<ul>
	<li>We know what we need to do, but it doesn't mean that things that we need to do are easy to get right!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Broadcast mode in Universities - do you know how much email you are actually sending to a student institutionally!</li>
	<li>Mobile devices are becoming centred around notifications - students take ownership of the information that they receive form the university.</li>

All challenges are not distinct and separate - looking at a multimedia development course for support staff.
They are using Xerte.
Collective ownership, including management, of the digital capabilities agenda and priorities.
Sustained movement and process - it is not a technology question it is about practices.
Suggestion from the audience:
QAA: there are two themes which you can choose to be rated on - employability and the other digital literacy - it might bring up some of the themes in a visible way

Final thoughts on using Rise Leaderboarded
<ol>
	<li>I love it</li>
	<li>There are some UI design tweaks that would make it EVEN better - more sign-posting as to scoring and metrics and checkbox selection to apply scores would be helpful.</li>
	<li>Notifying players is a lovely feature!</li>
	<li>Manual is better in most cases but I may be a control freak or an adrenaline hound!</li>
	<li>Trying to listen to a live panel and monitor twitter...and score...and liveblog = cognitive dissonance</li>

Live blogging from the conference, which took place on the 29th of April, 2015 at University of Salford, Manchester.
Introductory statement - Martin Cope points to factors which have stood in the way of widespread adoption of mobile technologies in further and higher education. We have reached beyond the tipping point, folks in attendance have an array of titles related to eLearning, but there is still much networking and collaboration to be done.
First speaker: Jon Fowler
Introducing the technology for use during the conference. We are using an app called meetoo.
Meetoo is a real-time messaging and poling app
Can access from Apple, Android and HTML
Web-based
Like many applications of this flavour it requires a pin to join up to the session.
He is running the ""instructor/meeting lead"" from his device. Real-time results much like poll everywhere.
Has a nice free text function, which has the option to be moderated as well.

Association for Learning Technology (ALT)
<strong>Policy, openness, learners, professionalisation and scale</strong>
For the past 10 years, papers on Ed Tech the world will be changed by <em>x</em> technology. But <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> challenges have meant that things have not changed all that much.
Discussion of policy in the making
- FELTAG - Further Education Learning Technology Action Group <a href=""http://feltag.org.uk"">FELTAG site</a>
- ETAG - Education Technology Action Group
Can we only be open about success?
Mention of the OER15 conference: <a href=""https://oer15.oerconf.org"">https://oer15.oerconf.org </a>
Does what we want from learning and teaching actually change?
Does the role of education change?
Is Learning Technology any different now from 5,10, 15, 20 years?
Some of the developments in technology and the pace of change is hard to contend with - how can we keep pace? More collaboration will help.
Why teach each other
- Share between industry and sectors
- Open
- Sustainable
- Empowered professionalism
- Learning Technology for everyone
- Internal research + collaboration
Staff have a growing set of requirements for their own professional development.
Check out the #ocTEL course - this was an online course which ALT ran. Now available as an open resource
We are part of an exciting time in learning technology!

Jonny Driscoll
Founder and CEO, Unipin
Driscoll came up with the concept of Unipin while he was at University. Noticed that there were lots of events at the university, but hardly anyone was in attendance.
Refers in Simin Sinec talk on tech, talks about innovative tech.
Mentions the Social Learning Model
Unipin is a social learning environment - engage students
Personalised activities lists, modelled on Pinterest-like wireframing.
Student and staff focus
Talking about the balance of academic and social experiences as being important to university life and experience.
Group chat based around module structure.
Can upload videos from mobile
Has calendar and notification system and suggested events based upon the student's profiles.
Mention that they record their achievements in the system - a kind of portfolio at the end of their time at the university.
The tool is aimed at student retention and getting students to attend events and taking part in uni-life and extracurricular clubs and societies.
Also in-lecture reminders and note taking functionality.
Less than 10% of students respond to their emails - not an efficient way to communicate with students.
""The fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with people who are already the way you want to be"" - Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn
Taskbar - university tab. Trying to make a seamless journey between social and learning aspects.
Social data analysis is mentioned as well - learner journey - as a record of what you have worked on.
Employers perspectives - Unipin has a record of what students have worked on.
Works across devices, tries to minimise distractions - logging into Moodle versus Unipin
Challenge was, find yesterday's lecture notes: Moodle = 55s vs. Unipin = 15s
Returning to the idea of flow and chronology for presentation - SEE earlier post about Bb Student app.
At University of Birmingham - 100,000 Facebook posts per day
Has some dashboard functionality in terms of flagging ""at risk"" students to the instructor.
They use Trello to gain insight and ideas from students.
They are using student's devices to automate students' lecture attendance.

Talking about Leeds' involvement in FutureLearn
Interesting post about a course in acting, namely biomechanics, a very physical method and how that could be successfully taught online.
Every lecture is 5mins long, scripted and highly produced - all produced as OERs
Recommend the use of animations to aid conceptual understanding.
Essentially pointing towards to the importance of visualisation (unsurprisingly I am a big fan of that!)
MOOC are nice but are not a strong recruitment tool - consideration of the profile of completers
Towards a Flipped Learning vision - mentions that lecture attendance has not been negatively impacted by flipped. Findings will be published in a paper.

Dave Harrison
Director and Co-Founder 10Eighty
Makes point about retention of material from lecture delivery.
His point is classroom training doesn't embed learning
Tying in points around social learning and employability.
How can we use technology to engage with students on an ongoing basis?
Students are your brand ambassadors
The future of work:
- mobile device is your office
- learning in the workplace will be via video, games and simulations
- networking is key
- knowledge workers
- corporate social networks
- social media literate
<strong>But what is it?</strong>
A leadership cloud - discussions, shared documents - part social media platform, part repository by the looks of things
Crowd sourcing for project work as an exemplar use.
Talk of reverse mentoring in organisations and using the tool to support that.

Dr Aleksej Heinze
Co-Director for Digital Business, Salford Business School
University of Salford
Part of the centre for digital business
Key points:
- using Moocs to enhance Salford's international presence
Lessons from the past:
- Students are more likely to enrol if they know us already
- Highest sources of student registration conversions:
<ul>
	<li>Internet search engines</li>
	<li>University of Salford website</li>
</ul>
Talk of Google Analytics
Why a MOOC?
Search and Social Media Marketing for International business - MOOC
Resources to help students engage with different online technologies.
They monitored which videos were most popular.
Used Twitter, Dokeos, Slideshare and YouTube for delivery of their materials
Iversity is the new MOOC kid-on-the-block and Salford are working with them in future.
Businessculture.org site analytics were encouraging showing access of the new resource.
Key lessons - businessculture.org
<ul>
	<li>Strategic use of Search Engine Optimisation</li>
	<li>Content marketing is key for future student recruitment</li>
</ul>

Jon Fowler
From LUMI - talk of meetoo app
Cloud-based system, very quickly able to produce a report.
Very nice looking spreadsheet analysis - this is something that meetoo seems to do well in comparison to some other systems
Audience comment: value in sentiment analysis rather than looking at individual responses.
Functionality coming out in the next release:
Adding a discussion thread and the option to vote-up questions.

Last week, I received an email featuring questions about how to use an iPad to support qualitative research fieldwork. I have explored many facets of using an iPad, but thinking about the device in relation to research pulls together some of the most useful functions into a neat contextual package which you can tap-into (pun intended!). Essentially for new users, research can be a gateway to get more out of your device and for established users...research can also be a gateway to get more out of your device! I owe a debt of gratitude to the person who sent me such good questions; as not only have they inspired this blog post, but they have also laid the trail for today's #appswap.

So here are my initial thoughts on the app with a few caveats:
<ul>
	<li>It is early days for this app and I believe that it is a Beta, see the Blackboard labs site for more details: <a title=""Blackboard Labs"" href=""http://www.blackboard.com/sites/labs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.blackboard.com/sites/labs/</a></li>
	<li>This app bears a strong relationship to the User Interface (UI) and structural changes which are to come as part of the Ultra release. This release will not be available for a while (estimated 2016) and even when it is, it may take a while for institutions to move to that version due to the complete re-design planned for the UI.

	<li>Finally these are just my initial observations and I fully acknowledge that there may be structural and terminology changes prior to a release of the app in the UK. Also as the app is a Beta, I accept that changes and updates may currently be in the works to improve functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Information Design and Structure</strong></h2>
This app is designed for a smartphone screen size and has an immediacy to the presentation of information which I like. Upon opening the app you would* be confronted by the useful, just-in-time information in your <em>Stream. </em>Your <em>Stream </em>would aggregate course and module activity and replies to your blog/wiki/discussion board posts. This is somewhat similar to the updates aggregated within the <a title=""Global Navigation and other updates in April 2014"" href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearning/2014/06/09/whats-new-in-studentcentral/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Global Navigation</a> (April 2014 version of Blackboard). A downwards sweep with a finger reveals that the structure of this app is very simple; you can access your <em>Stream</em> or your <em>Courses</em> and there are no other complications. Well almost...there is a cog icon to indicate settings options, but at this point there is nothing to access in that area and a feedback area for entry of a contact email address.
*Would = the stream is not loading on my version of the app. I am able to access my institutional materials in the Courses area, but our implementation of Blackboard is not configured for the stream at this time.
<h4><strong>Courses</strong></h4>
At the top of the Courses area there is a large header stating the word ""Current"", this suggests that at some point the app will distinguish between the current term, or current modules/courses being studied and past modules/courses. We cannot see that distinction within the app yet, but this is a promising development as a means to help signpost students to the correct information.
Each course is shown as a rectangular block, featuring a coloured strip, a title, the name of the <em>Professor* </em>(academic staff person) and a spot for their avatar (<a title=""avatar definition"" href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/avatar"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">avatar definition, see ""4""</a>). There are a couple of potential issues with this, if you have more than one instructor assigned to an area then the area is listed as ""Professor not yet assigned"". Furthermore even in a module area when only one instructor was assigned and 'said' instructor had an avatar loaded within Blackboard, ""Professor not yet assigned"" is still shown on the Course block and the avatar is not picked up; only a black circle with a question mark on it is displayed. This speaks to two points, where is app looking to find avatars and does it have very specific requirements for compatible images? Also the use of roles within Blackboard may become more pertinent in future, this aligns with my experience of working with moodle in the US due to the <a title=""FERPA information"" href=""http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">FERPA</a> legislation which is akin to data protection and mandates whom can access coursework and grades etc. Use of access-based roles is important in order to comply with the rules outlined in FERPA.
Pressing on a Course block takes you into that specific course/module area. Within the course area, the instructor name and image is shown at the top with resources immediately below, and this is where it gets interesting, most of your content areas will be ignored and in our case the app is only picking a content area which we label as ""Study Materials"" by default within all out modules. Furthermore if I look at a specific module within ""Study Materials"" I have the following content types: <em>items,</em> these are not shown in the app; a <em>wiki,</em> this is not shown within the app; and a <em>journal</em>, which is also not shown within the app. What is shown, are <em>folders, weblinks</em>, you can see a <em>test </em>activity exists, but you cannot yet take it. I do think that the windowed in-app browser for viewing web pages is a step in the right direction, it includes back (&lt;) and forward (&gt;) arrows, a refresh and an option to copy the link or open it in the native OS web browser (iOS Safari). This is a marked improvement on how web pages display in the Blackboard Mobile Learn app in my opinion. Without more development related to the display of content items, I cannot comment further on those aspects of the app at this time.
*As shown in the screen shot below it looks like there would be a time and location in the course/module area as well. This briefly flickers up when loading but then disappears as that kind of data is not available in our instance of Blackboard.

<h2>User Interface Design and User Experience</h2>
First of all, a few points about the UI. I think that it is pretty good although it does suffer from the same issue as the Blackboard Mobile Learn app, a bleach-white backdrop. However unlike the Blackboard Mobile Learn app you do not end up with a matryoshka doll effect, where the nesting levels can become very confusing. What I like about it is that when you are in a folder in this app, you are actually <strong>in</strong> that folder and you press an X to get out of it, and back up to the next level. This flattened structure where we essentially end up with one content area seems to correlate with what I have seen of Ultra.
The new <em>folder</em>, <em>link</em> and <em>course</em> icon design is strong and easy to understand. The removal of the shadowing effects seen in the desktop version of Blackboard, in favour of simple vector graphics in the app is a good decision. The icons are even further simplified than the versions that we see in Blackboard Mobile Learn app, yet similar enough to give existing users a frame of reference. I do think that the choice of a stock-icon wireframe globe icon to represent the stream is a weak point. The <em>posts </em>icon currently used in the Global Navigation would seem more evocative of a stream if we're talking icons (quite like an Aquarius star sign symbol, so that association makes sense).
[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""63""]<img class="""" src=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearning/files/2014/06/gn_activity_stream-2ebbhqg.png"" alt=""posts icon - from Blackboard Global Navigation"" width=""63"" height=""67"" /> posts icon - from Global Navigation[/caption]
&nbsp;
The navigation is probably my favourite aspect of the app. From the two options at the outset in the app home area, <em>Stream</em> or <em>Courses, </em>to the pile of your recently visited courses/modules gathered at the bottom of 'said' home area, there is a welcome level of simplicity. I also like the forethought put into multiple navigation paths, especially in terms of returning to the previous level of the app. So if you are in a course/module, you can sweep a finger down from the top and return to the course/module listings, another sweep down will take you to the home area. If that isn't intuitive, and for some it won't be, there is a ""burger-style"" menu (design~ ""<a title=""Burger icon - Johan Van Dem Rym's Site"" href=""http://jvandenrym.me/2014/10/10/the-beefy-icon/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">burger</a>"" or ""club sandwich"") on the top-left of every view that will take you back to the home area. What is particularly unique about the interface, is that in order to provide the user with confirmation of shifting levels, the bars which identify which level you are on give a satisfying jelly-like bounce when you use a finger to sweep upwards or downloads. The ""burger"" menu also has a bounce to it, a bit like your finger's pressure left an indent in it. Nice little design touches which add a bit of character to the app. Another good feature is the use of vibrant colour as an affirmation of touch selections in the grey/black home area.
<strong>Suggestions for Improvement</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Allow users to change the background colour. Yes, white says clean and simple, but it presents accessibility issues for Dyslexic users. A plus on accessibility for font choice and sizing though!</li>
	<li>Bring in more content types soon please! I would love to see how a blog or discussion board will be shown in this app.</li>
	<li>Bring in some simple sorting to the course area. I see where we are going with the Ultra structure (only the current courses being shown) but the arbitrary colour stripes for each course seem like a step backwards. I think that users might expect the sorting and colour labelling available in Blackboard Mobile Learn app.</li>
</ul>
Overall I think that this app has a lot of potential, although it has quite a long way to go. I look forward to seeing how the functionality develops over the coming months.

Recently I was asked to present at the Media-Enhanced Learning Special Interest Group (MELSIG) event hosted by the University of Sussex. MELSIG is a special interest group originally formed in 2008 (MELSIG, 2014). The group's focus has evolved, alongside contemporary developments in technology, to include investigation of a wide variety of digital media when applied to the support of learning and teaching. The theme for the University of Sussex event was <em>Digital Media Interaction and Inclusivity</em> and this was exactly the prompt I needed to engage in more thorough research of in-app adjustment functions which has been preoccupation of mine for a while.

<em>Embedded Nearpod Presentation from MELSIG event </em>
Through my work building 'communities of practice' (Wenger, 1998) on both sides of the Atlantic, and in particular during the development of <a title=""DIY – Build Your Own App Swap Events"" href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearning/the-team/case-studies/diy-build-your-own-app-swap-breakfasts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>App Swap</em> </a>events at the University of Brighton something always bothered me about apps or mobile applications/software. Namely why, when developers have such rich <a title=""Software Development Kit"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SDKs</a> to work with, isn't there more attention to paid to inclusivity when designing apps? Both the iOS and Android operating systems have a number of built-in functions which have the potential to greatly aid accessibility in addition to the benefits afforded by the touchscreens and the form factors of the devices themselves. However, due to the unique conditions under which apps are developed a combination of factors including time/monetary constraints, corporate interests and the lack of a common accessibility guidelines seem to stifle the potential of certain apps on the accessibility front. Indeed within app development no equivalent to the <a title=""WC3 WAI"" href=""http://www.w3.org/WAI/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WC3's Web Accessibility Initiative</a> seems to have emerged and the rule systems applied to website design such as the <a title=""EU Internet Handbook"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/standards/accessibility/index_en.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">EU Internet Handbook</a> have no bearing on the design of apps. On the one hand this is quite liberating for interface designers and has led to something of a <em>Wild West</em> populated by some truly innovative interface designs.
My intention with this post, I should point out, is not to stifle innovation, but rather I would like to propose that when an app's primary purpose falls within certain categories of use, 'categories' which can be applied to the creation or consumption of educational materials or be used in support of learning, that extra attention be paid to the accessibility features of 'said' apps. Perhaps in the future this could resemble a set of agreed standards, but at this time I would like to make more of a humble request rather than a full recommendation. The core idea I put forth in relation to my 'request' is the notion of letting the user choose and customise the app through the presence of 'adjustment'; this I believe is a key facet of the path to accessibility. I shall expand on 'categories of use' later in this post.
A personal experience which prompted this line of enquiry was my use of Amazon's Kindle app for iPad. In October 2011 Apple introduced support of text-to-speech (TTS) within their iOS5 operating system (Moren, D. 2012); as a Dyslexic person I was eager to make use of this function and to this day find it immensely useful. Imagine my disappointment to find out that the 'Speak Selection' tool is actively blocked within the Kindle app. The 'VoiceOver' tool was later allowed within the Kindle for iPad app (Ingber, J. 2013) and Amazon had introduced its own text-to-speech function to the Kindle 2 device in 2009 but eBook publishers could choose to disallow the function with the viewpoint that it might damage audiobook sales (Schofield, J. 2009). There is another aspect of the Kindle app which always seems a bit of an oversight; reading background colours. Given the development resources available to Amazon, there are only three options provided for the text background colour: White, Black (X-Ray) and Sepia. Why not make the reading experience as accessible as possible by including customisable background colours as evidenced by apps like <a title=""bluefire reader developer site"" href=""http://www.bluefirereader.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bluefire Reader</a>, <a title=""Kobo Reader apps"" href=""http://www.kobo.com/apps"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kobo Reader</a> and <a title=""Goodreader developer site"" href=""http://www.goodiware.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodreader</a>? When comparing Kindle to particularly Kobo reader and Goodreader one is reminded of the oft used technological paradigm of VHS and Betamax; VHS won due to market share in combination with other factors rather than viewing quality.
On the topic of background colour more specifically, from a personal perspective this is the number one 'adjustment' which I would like to see made available in apps. Particularly those apps which are promoted as 'readers'. My own perception of black text on a white background has been a persistent barrier to my consumption and enjoyment of reading. To help elaborate on my own experience I even created <a title=""dylexic irlen sketch"" href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a javascript web application</a> (using <a title=""processing.org"" href=""http://processing.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Processing</a>) to show what this experience is like for me. This is a condition sometimes known as Irlen Syndrome, Meres-Irlen Syndrome, Visual Stress or Scoptopic Sensitivity syndrome. I am hesitant to adopt any of these definitions as an explanation of my experience, as I have never received an official diagnosis. Furthermore there are some sceptical viewpoints in the medical fields when assessing the diagnostic procedures and the original studies which led to the recognition of the symptoms (Coyle, B. 1995 and Lawrence, J. 2008). I prefer to view it as a complex part of my own dyslexic puzzle and one thing is not in doubt, the ability to adjust background colours, fonts and font-sizes makes a huge difference to my experience of reading.
So why the title of <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>? The 2011 film, <em>The Adjustment Bureau </em>based on the Phillip K. Dick's short story, <em>The Adjustment Team</em> (1954 - <a title=""full text source"" href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adjustment_Team"">full text</a>) which tells of characters whose life choices deviate from a preordained plan set-out by a mysterious organisation. Inspired by this idea I postulated that there may be a parallel between that concept and app developers whose choices are guided or pushed by a combination of external factors and client influences, ultimately I wondered whether this explains why the avenues to accessibility are so seldom followed? With all of this in mind I decided to enter into an assessment of the adjustment functionality available within some of the most prominent and popular apps I have encountered while working in Higher Education. I focused on apps available for iOS for this pursuit as that is the primary device type supported in my workplace and I had access to the devices. This also prompted me to define some basic 'categories of use' when applied to app use within academia for the support of learning and teaching.
The <strong>Categories of Use</strong> are as follows:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Category</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Browser</td>
<td>A web browser for navigating web-based information. May include other features such as reader functions and RSS curation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Composer</td>
<td>In this context for the composition of text-based materials and documents.<strong></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consumer</td>
<td>For curation and consumption of RSS content, blogs and online news sources.<strong></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Notetaker/annotation</td>
<td>Apps with the main purpose of taking notes and/or placing notes and annotation on documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reader</td>
<td>Apps with the primary purpose of reading text, eBooks, ePubs, PDF and other text formats. May have limited annotation tools.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
When defining the categories I tried to resist the use of pre-existing desktop software definitions such as for example '<em>word processing'. </em>These definitions have established associations and many apps reach beyond the format-based outputs which are expected from these former software definitions.
The <strong>Adjustment </strong><strong>Criteria</strong> upon which each app was judged are listed below. If an app includes a feature it is awarded a point for that criterion, it may partially allow a feature which would result in a 0.5 of a point. The total score is a point value out of a total of 8, for the 8 criteria and is shown as a final percentage. Apps which achieve &gt;=60% are highlighted in purple.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Criterion</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Font Size</td>
<td>Font size can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Line Height</td>
<td>Line height can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Font Style</td>
<td>Font style can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Invert/Brightness</td>
<td>Brightness of the display or invert (white text on black background) is a specific option within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sepia</td>
<td>A sepia background (beige/mild yellow) is a specific option within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sliders/Colour</td>
<td>A selection of colours or Red/Green/Blue sliders allow the user to adjust and specify the background colour within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pinch zoom</td>
<td>The pinch zoom is a built-in function of the iOS. Some apps do not make/allow full use of this touch-based function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS Speak Selection</td>
<td>A function which can be enabled in the General &gt; Accessibility functions in the iOS this can be used by selecting text in certain apps and pressing the 'speak' option which comes up. This is distinct from the 'Voiceover' option which is a complete audio interface and harder use for quick impromptu needs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The scores as an embedded Google Spreadsheet - a work in progress. NB: this list is not designed to be exhaustive and if you have other apps which you would like me to assess using these criteria, please add them to the comments area below. The ""+"" next to the app title identifies that the app is available for both iPhone and iPad.

<strong>Conclusion
</strong>Through this process of investigation and app functionality testing I feel that I have only begun to scrape the surface of how accessibility functions are implemented and the possible avenues for improvement. I think that there is certainly scope to devise a more concrete scoring and testing system with the view to helping teachers and learners make informed decisions about the accessibility functions of certain apps. Such a system would also have the potential to help inform developers about the needs of specific user groups. However the responsibility cannot be squarely that of the developers, as users we also have a responsibility to let developers know what we want and need. One of the benefits of working with apps is that developers are often small to medium sized companies and really benefit from the suggestions from their user-base, this may extend to use testing. In the <em>Wild West</em> of apps we as the user have an opportunity to make a difference and we shouldn't miss out by sticking to the easy path.

1071,1,17/05/2020 23:51,17/05/2020 22:51,"<h2>Why am I here (as in you, at this blog, and reading this now)?</h2>
I hope you are here because you would like an introduction to using RStudio for data visualisation. I also hope that you are here because you are interested in <a href=""https://strategyn.com/customer-centered-innovation-map/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jobs-To-Be-Done</a> (abbrev~ JTBD; Ulwick, 2016). This blog provides an example of how to apply one of the approaches that sits under the mantle of JTBD, an Opportunity Landscape (Ulwick, 2016; VIII. Target Hidden Growth Opportunities section).
<h3>What are we going to do?</h3>
We are going to create a plot, or Opportunity Landscape (SEE also Ulwick, 2017), based on data from a quick opinion survey that was distributed via social media. Survey respondents were asked to rate particular tasks that they regularly complete on a smart watch according to importance and satisfaction on 5-part <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Likert scales</a>.
At this point I should add a caveat, for those familiar with JTBD. These questions were not based on full <em>job</em> statements or stories but were abbreviated task statements. This is largely because based on survey testing, I found that the time it took to read and consider longer Job stories, based on Situation-&gt;Motivation-&gt;Expected Outcome (Klement, 2016) required too much mental effort for a &lt;15min survey. I have found Job stories to be indispensable at the interview stage, when derived from transcripts as a means to uncover motivations. In the context of this post I would say that my methodology is a bit of a mash-up of JTBD and Gerry McGovern's top tasks (2010; 2017).
<h3>Why are creating a plot?</h3>
I believe that the true purpose of any plot is to start conversations. Data visualisations have the power to both subvert truth and to challenge commonly held assumptions, I aim for the latter. Always.
<h3>Why are we using RStudio with ggplot2?</h3>
The beauty of using RStudio with ggplot2 is...well beauty. Most people can make standard Excel visualisations without too much effort, but even with a lot of tweaking they still have a heady whiff. In the past I used Adobe Illustrator, but speaking of my own failings it was too easy to leave the land of accuracy and enter the land of surface-treatment.
Here are my top reasons why you should consider using RStudio with ggplot2:
<ul>
 	<li>You know how to use Microsoft Excel, but would like to create better visualisations...</li>
 	<li>You have lots of data and you would like to segment it and look at a smaller portions without getting caught in a scrolling cycle-of-doom in a humongous spreadsheet...</li>
 	<li>You want something inexpensive - the only cost here is time, but it is well worth it...</li>
 	<li>Once you have built it, it can be used over and over and over...and tweaked quickly for whatever the need...</li>
 	<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> RStudio and gpplot2 can be used to prototype data visualisations for interface design and depending on your audience a realistic looking representation/visualisation could be very important.</li>
</ul>
If any of the statements above have piqued your interest then keep reading.
<h4>Step 1: Collect the Data, Show me the Data</h4>
In true Blue Peter style, here is one I made earlier...

[caption id=""attachment_884"" align=""alignnone"" width=""700""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JTBD_demo_image-1rd4pz7.png""><img class=""wp-image-884"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JTBD_demo_image-1rd4pz7.png"" alt=""Image of an Opportunity Landscape plot"" width=""700"" height=""560"" /></a> The plot above is based on Webcredible's fantastic blog post on the topic of JTBD <em>(Josephy, 2016).</em>[/caption]

I should add that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">your</span> plots can be much more extravagant than this, but essentially this is the basic type of plot that we are going to create to get started. The descriptive lines above are superfluous*. They are useful to keep commented-out in your code though as they can be used to create quick descriptive visuals for stakeholders when needed.
What we can read from the visualisation above is that I could have asked about a lot more <em>jobs</em>; it is a bit sparse, but 12 jobs is what this particular survey could accommodate. Also the majority of the jobs fall into the 'overserved' domain. This means satisfaction has been rated higher than importance and according to Ulwick (2016) this is prime territory for disruption. So although initially, when I looked at this visualisation I was like ""oh blast"", as I was looking for some untapped potential related to smart watch jobs and there is none. Actually it is more that customers are overserved for jobs that aren't perceived as that important and therefore the landscape is primed for some new competitor to come in and do the job in a cheaper and perhaps less good, but cheaper way, which though market adoption and iteration of 'said' cheap version may eventually lead to something better (Ulwick, 2016). Of course another dimension would be to ask questions about jobs that have not yet been considered for smart watch, but these were out of scope for this particular survey. In a way this plot perfectly sums up smart watches as they are still finding their footing, they are still superfluous to the smartphone which is almost ubiquitous.
The point I am getting to here is that this plot asks questions of the data, that we might not normally ask if we were looking at each question in isolation. It is only when we bring these jobs together that we reach a new level of meaning.
*Edward Tufte (2001) would likely frown to see these lines - ""erase non-data-ink"" (p. 105).
<h4>Collect the data</h4>
You will need a survey question something like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_display-w6adj4.jpg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-885"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_display-w6adj4.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of survey question"" width=""700"" height=""401"" /></a>
...Or split it into two versions of the same question depending on the allowances of your survey tool.
<strong>""DANGER, WILL ROBINSON!!!!""</strong>

<blockquote>Q: Hey didn't you say earlier that you need a 5 part Likert scale? But you only have four options in the 'satisfaction' scale above?</blockquote>
The answer is I had to take a difficult decision about the experience of users on smartphones using my survey. One more column and it was over the precipice into the land of non-function. As I am only interested in 'Quite Important' and 'Very Important' and 'Satisfied' and 'Highly Satisfied' in this context I sacrificed the final column.
So the results for the first question looked like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_result-qp4oul.jpg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-887"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/00_result-qp4oul.jpg"" alt=""Image of results"" width=""700"" height=""533"" /></a>
For the Satisfaction element, I created an <a href=""https://support.office.com/en-us/article/IFS-function-36329a26-37b2-467c-972b-4a39bd951d45"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">IFS Function</a> in my final spreadsheet, to make 4 equaled 5, 3 equaled 4, 2 equaled 3 and 1 equaled 2. This put everything on the same scale.
<h4>Download the data</h4>
Any good survey tool should allow you to download the results to CSV format (Comma Separated Values) and any survey tool worth its salt should also provide a SPSS or data analysis format which codes each response with a number. So in my case I wanted to the most positive response to have the highest rank value. I am going to use Excel to sort the data, as that is/was my comfort zone and I think that it is good to start from a position of confidence and trust in the original figures prior to visualising them. Personally speaking after only a few months of working with RStudio, I now feel happy to complete the entire workflow in RStudio.
<h4>Tip: Split up your Importance (IMP) and Satisfaction (SAT) onto separate tabs in your Excel spreadsheet</h4>
Believe me this will make your life SO much easier, when it comes to doing your calculations.
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sort-the-data.001-1jk68l1.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-888 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sort-the-data.001-1jk68l1.jpeg"" alt=""Image of sort data slide"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /></a>
<h4>Step 2: Do the Maths</h4>
Having separated your data, create a new tab in your spreadsheet and create the rows defined in the column labelled <strong>A</strong> below. Then use the data on your Importance tab to populate column <strong>B. </strong>Start with one question-worth of data, we'll get to the rest of your questions soon.
<ul>
 	<li>So for row 3 ""total importance"": count all the entries in the importance column for that particular job from the first data row to the last - indicated by A<em>x</em> [COUNTA].</li>
 	<li>For row 4 we want to count how many of these entries had a rating of 4 (Quite Important) and 5 (Very Important). So we use a COUNTIF formula to look at values greater than 3. As we aren't dealing with decimals (yet), ""&gt;3"" is accurate enough for this purpose.</li>
 	<li>For row 5 we need to find out what percentage of overall responses are <em>Quite</em> and <em>Very Important</em>. So we divide row 4 by row 3 and then times by 10.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Create identical rows for satisfaction</strong> (after in my case, adjusting it upwards first, due to having a satisfaction scale of 4 parts), so that you end up with this...
<h4>The Opportunity Algorithm</h4>
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/presentation.001-28jxl4y.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-891 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/presentation.001-28jxl4y.jpeg"" alt=""Image of the opportunity algorithm"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /></a>
So you will need a final row, row 10 to calculate the <strong>Opportunity Score</strong>. This is outlined above, but to explain the contents of the image. You take the outcome of importance, which is your percentage, so 9.6 in this case and take away the outcome of satisfaction, again a percentage. So that would leave you with -0.1, then add back on the outcome percentage which is is 9.6 and you end up with the total opportunity score of 9.5.
outcome importance +
(outcome importance - outcome satisfaction)
= Opportunity Score
9.6 + (9.6 - 9.7) = 9.5
This is not the most exciting opportunity score, the most exciting ones are more than 10, or better yet more than 12.
Oh and here is why I said that you should start with the formulae for one question-worth of data and to split Importance and Satisfaction onto separate sheets...Once you have created one column for Importance and Satisfaction data you can simply drag the formulae across all of your questions.

<h4>Create R Food</h4>
Having done all that you need to get your data into columns for RStudio, specifically we want four columns to start off with: Job; Importance; Satisfaction; Opportunity; and Score.
So that it looks like this...

Tip to get your data from rows to these columns use the transpose(array) function in Excel, here it is in action...

<h4>Step 4: OoooH aRrrrr</h4>
Launch RStudio and have a go!

So now that you have done all of the preparation you can actually start to create plots. Before you do anything else you need to load your library. In this case we are using ggplot2 which is part of <a href=""https://www.tidyverse.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hadley Wickham's (and others) Tidyverse</a> - packages for R with standardised concepts and grammar. This is a good place to start as I have found that some of the R packages are quite idiosyncratic and it can take a bit of time to wrap your head around the internal logic, whereas the Tidyverse stuff all made a lot of sense. This could be because I originally learned to code in the JavaScript iteration of <a href=""https://processing.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Processing.</a>
RStudio comes with a lot of packages already, so...
<pre>[sourcecode language=""plain""]library(gpplot2)[/sourcecode]</pre>
If you needed to install it first and say you wanted the whole Tidyverse it would intuitively be...
<pre>[sourcecode language=""plain""]install.packages(tidyverse)[/sourcecode]</pre>
Next you need to define your data and as you will recall we set that us as a .csv file on the desktop so lets call the data 'jtdb'...
<pre>[sourcecode language=""plain""]
library(gpplot2)
jtbd &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;- read.csv(""~/Desktop/JTBD_R/jtbd.csv"", header = T)
#This is a comment in RMarkup, so lets also find out about the data itself by using the summary function
summary(jtbd)
[/sourcecode]</pre>
<strong>Result in the console:</strong>
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resultinconsole-t8dbkw.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-910"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resultinconsole-t8dbkw.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of results in console"" width=""515"" height=""339"" /></a>
Well...that is jolly helpful information!
<h4>Now for the plot part:</h4>
<pre>[sourcecode language=""plain""]
#the plot mapping - telling where your data to map on the axis
ggplot(jtbd, aes(x=Importance, y=Satisfaction))+
# the ""+"" allows you to add another function, each function goes on its own layer,
#so the order is important for example geom_point defines your data as points on the plot
geom_point(color=""blue"", alpha=0.5, size=4)+
# To map aesthetics in a more intentional way - for instance adding labels,
# we can use another function geom label which requires two variables
#(in this case Importance and Satisfaction)
# and tell it which column to get the labels from, in this case, the ""Job"" column
geom_label(aes(label = jtbd$Job), nudge_y = 0.08, nudge_x = 0.06, hjust=""right"", alpha=0.8, size=4)
[/sourcecode]</pre>
This gives a starter plot like this...
<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/star_R-244yio2.png""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-914 size-full"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/star_R-244yio2.png"" alt=""Image of starter plot"" width=""800"" height=""429"" /></a>
Just to prove that it is easy to get started I gave myself a little challenge...
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NJY0dQdV-7I?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
After that it is really all about the aesthetics with this particular plot. Specifically I added a data.frame (a container for data) for each aesthetic element such as text, lines, shaded polygons and areas. These were then called as shown below...
<pre>[sourcecode language=""plain""]
#Labels for the areas of the plot
labelover &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;- data.frame(
x = 1,
y = 9.5,
label=""OVERSERVED""
)
#Potential for disruption line
segment4 &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;- data.frame(
x = 0,
y = 2,
xend = 7,
yend = 10
)
#further down in the code where the plot is created - I call these#
ggplot(jtbd, aes(x=Importance, y=Satisfaction)) +
#Calling the text
geom_text(data = labelover, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size=5) +
#Calling the 'potential for disruption line' and adding some annotation to it
geom_segment(data = segment4, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend), alpha=0.2, linetype=2) +
annotate(""text"", x = 5.1, y = 9, label = ""Potential for disruption"")
[/sourcecode]</pre>
<h4>Step 5: Aesthetics</h4>
Well that provides an overview of the basics the rest will be based on your own aesthetic decisions. So I have provided the full code work-up with annotation below and recommend that you have a go and explore. Also if any of you are R and ggplot2 'pros' I am open to feedback as I am sure that it could be improved.
To summarise, from my perspective using RStudio has provided the following benefits:
<ul>
 	<li>A fast way to create reproducible visualisations of JTBD data</li>
 	<li>An effective way to create prototype data visualisations for a range of design contexts</li>
 	<li>An inexpensive option when compared to other data packages. Although I can get a student discount on software at the moment, I was thinking about the long term and developing a skill with an open source package</li>
 	<li>It has helped me to think differently about data and to iterate visualisations in the same way that I would with other design projects</li>
 	<li>It is immensely satisfying</li>
</ul>

1080,1,18/05/2020 00:07,17/05/2020 23:07,"I knew that all of that work that I did on polls would come in handy at some point. The <em>time</em> arrived, as displaying data was something that seemed important from the beginning, to support the goals for the project. I wanted to support the information about 'UK smart device ownership' with some data.
Having spent quite a bit of time <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/12/24/on-the-importance-of-self-discipline/"">looking at polling options </a>and trying things out, I felt sure that the the Google Charts api (n.d.) would give me the level of interactivity and customisation required.
<!--more-->
<h3>Something I changed</h3>
Like the tools I had used already (see earlier entries including Flickity by metafizzy (2016), smooth-scroll by cfernandi (2016)) the instructions always say to call the JavaScript package in the header. This is something that my instructor, Marcus, had pointed out as bad practice. Therefore, I created a new eventlistener in my JavaScript file in order to load google's ""loader.js"" script. This allowed me to place the &lt;script&gt; tag at the bottom of my index.html file. However, unlike the other widgets and code snippets that I have used, I cannot compile Google's JavaScript as part of my own script (Google, 2016a), it has to be loaded from Google servers (licensed under Apache license version 2.0 (2004) ). For this reason I reused the loading GIF from the contact form, to show while the chart loads.
The data itself is from Offcom's report entitled, The Communications Market, 5 Internet and Online Content (2016a, p. 191). What is great about their site is that they make the raw data available in Microsoft Excel format, so I was able to construct the chart based on a subset of data (Ofcom, 2016b). In order to show the age versus ownership I selected a stacked barchart as a space efficient way to show the data.
<h3>Prepping the chart for print</h3>
I have still to create my print stylesheet, which is something that I will do towards the end of the project. In the meantime it made sense to make sure that the chart was prepped for printing to png. I am not going to make a link to the png available as that function will run in browsers which support the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element (Google, 2016c). However, what customising this script did do, was create a static view of the chart showing it in suitable format for printing.
<h3>Tab clear</h3>
I decided that I needed to highlight the User Experience section of the portfolio page design, as it was all very wordy. There is still a lot to consider in this area, but I decided to add a tab image on the top-left of the UX factors (formerly scenarios) section. I started by creating an svg, partially inspired by a post on CSS-Tricks (Coyier, 2013). However, I really wasn't happy with it in terms of formatting and scaling. For now I have replaced it with a tab which I created using pure CSS. The tab is actually made of two divs, one for the the main tab shape (rounded rectangle) and one for the slant leading up to it using the skewX transform option. However, I will have to replace this as it is only compatible with IE11 or later (Can I use, 2016). It is a shame, but it was good to learn about the transform option and again I used the ::before pseudo element to add text content on the div.

Ultimately, I will need to go back to an svg solution, but I will draw it to look like what I came up with using the CSS.

Recently I was asked to present at the Media-Enhanced Learning Special Interest Group (MELSIG) event hosted by the University of Sussex. MELSIG is a special interest group originally formed in 2008 (MELSIG, 2014). The group's focus has evolved, alongside contemporary developments in technology, to include investigation of a wide variety of digital media when applied to the support of learning and teaching. The theme for the University of Sussex event was <em>Digital Media Interaction and Inclusivity</em> and this was exactly the prompt I needed to engage in more thorough research of in-app adjustment functions which has been preoccupation of mine for a while.

Through my work building 'communities of practice' (Wenger, 1998) on both sides of the Atlantic, and in particular during the development of <a title=""DIY – Build Your Own App Swap Events"" href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearning/the-team/case-studies/diy-build-your-own-app-swap-breakfasts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>App Swap</em> </a>events at the University of Brighton something always bothered me about apps or mobile applications/software. Namely why, when developers have such rich <a title=""Software Development Kit"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SDKs</a> to work with, isn't there more attention to paid to inclusivity when designing apps? Both the iOS and Android operating systems have a number of built-in functions which have the potential to greatly aid accessibility in addition to the benefits afforded by the touchscreens and the form factors of the devices themselves. However, due to the unique conditions under which apps are developed a combination of factors including time/monetary constraints, corporate interests and the lack of a common accessibility guidelines seem to stifle the potential of certain apps on the accessibility front. Indeed within app development no equivalent to the <a title=""WC3 WAI"" href=""http://www.w3.org/WAI/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WC3's Web Accessibility Initiative</a> seems to have emerged and the rule systems applied to website design such as the <a title=""EU Internet Handbook"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/standards/accessibility/index_en.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">EU Internet Handbook</a> have no bearing on the design of apps. On the one hand this is quite liberating for interface designers and has led to something of a <em>Wild West</em> populated by some truly innovative interface designs.
My intention with this post, I should point out, is not to stifle innovation, but rather I would like to propose that when an app's primary purpose falls within certain categories of use, 'categories' which can be applied to the creation or consumption of educational materials or be used in support of learning, that extra attention be paid to the accessibility features of 'said' apps. Perhaps in the future this could resemble a set of agreed standards, but at this time I would like to make more of a humble request rather than a full recommendation. The core idea I put forth in relation to my 'request' is the notion of letting the user choose and customise the app through the presence of 'adjustment'; this I believe is a key facet of the path to accessibility. I shall expand on 'categories of use' later in this post.
A personal experience which prompted this line of enquiry was my use of Amazon's Kindle app for iPad. In October 2011 Apple introduced support of text-to-speech (TTS) within their iOS5 operating system (Moren, D. 2012); as a Dyslexic person I was eager to make use of this function and to this day find it immensely useful. Imagine my disappointment to find out that the 'Speak Selection' tool is actively blocked within the Kindle app. The 'VoiceOver' tool was later allowed within the Kindle for iPad app (Ingber, J. 2013) and Amazon had introduced its own text-to-speech function to the Kindle 2 device in 2009 but eBook publishers could choose to disallow the function with the viewpoint that it might damage audiobook sales (Schofield, J. 2009). There is another aspect of the Kindle app which always seems a bit of an oversight; reading background colours. Given the development resources available to Amazon, there are only three options provided for the text background colour: White, Black (X-Ray) and Sepia. Why not make the reading experience as accessible as possible by including customisable background colours as evidenced by apps like <a title=""bluefire reader developer site"" href=""http://www.bluefirereader.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bluefire Reader</a>, <a title=""Kobo Reader apps"" href=""http://www.kobo.com/apps"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kobo Reader</a> and <a title=""Goodreader developer site"" href=""http://www.goodiware.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodreader</a>? When comparing Kindle to particularly Kobo reader and Goodreader one is reminded of the oft used technological paradigm of VHS and Betamax; VHS won due to market share in combination with other factors rather than viewing quality.
On the topic of background colour more specifically, from a personal perspective this is the number one 'adjustment' which I would like to see made available in apps. Particularly those apps which are promoted as 'readers'. My own perception of black text on a white background has been a persistent barrier to my consumption and enjoyment of reading. To help elaborate on my own experience I even created <a title=""dylexic irlen sketch"" href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a javascript web application</a> (using <a title=""processing.org"" href=""http://processing.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Processing</a>) to show what this experience is like for me. This is a condition sometimes known as Irlen Syndrome, Meres-Irlen Syndrome, Visual Stress or Scoptopic Sensitivity syndrome. I am hesitant to adopt any of these definitions as an explanation of my experience, as I have never received an official diagnosis. Furthermore there are some sceptical viewpoints in the medical fields when assessing the diagnostic procedures and the original studies which led to the recognition of the symptoms (Coyle, B. 1995 and Lawrence, J. 2008). I prefer to view it as a complex part of my own dyslexic puzzle and one thing is not in doubt, the ability to adjust background colours, fonts and font-sizes makes a huge difference to my experience of reading.
So why the title of <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>? The 2011 film, <em>The Adjustment Bureau </em>based on the Phillip K. Dick's short story, <em>The Adjustment Team</em> (1954 - <a title=""full text source"" href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adjustment_Team"">full text</a>) which tells of characters whose life choices deviate from a preordained plan set-out by a mysterious organisation. Inspired by this idea I postulated that there may be a parallel between that concept and app developers whose choices are guided or pushed by a combination of external factors and client influences, ultimately I wondered whether this explains why the avenues to accessibility are so seldom followed? With all of this in mind I decided to enter into an assessment of the adjustment functionality available within some of the most prominent and popular apps I have encountered while working in Higher Education. I focused on apps available for iOS for this pursuit as that is the primary device type supported in my workplace and I had access to the devices. This also prompted me to define some basic 'categories of use' when applied to app use within academia for the support of learning and teaching.
The <strong>Categories of Use</strong> are as follows:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Category</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Browser</td>
<td>A web browser for navigating web-based information. May include other features such as reader functions and RSS curation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Composer</td>
<td>In this context for the composition of text-based materials and documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consumer</td>
<td>For curation and consumption of RSS content, blogs and online news sources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Notetaker/annotation</td>
<td>Apps with the main purpose of taking notes and/or placing notes and annotation on documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reader</td>
<td>Apps with the primary purpose of reading text, eBooks, ePubs, PDF and other text formats. May have limited annotation tools.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
When defining the categories I tried to resist the use of pre-existing desktop software definitions such as for example '<em>word processing'. </em>These definitions have established associations and many apps reach beyond the format-based outputs which are expected from these former software definitions.
The <strong>Adjustment </strong><strong>Criteria</strong> upon which each app was judged are listed below. If an app includes a feature it is awarded a point for that criterion, it may partially allow a feature which would result in a 0.5 of a point. The total score is a point value out of a total of 8, for the 8 criteria and is shown as a final percentage. Apps which achieve &gt;=60% are highlighted in purple.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Criterion</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Font Size</td>
<td>Font size can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Line Height</td>
<td>Line height can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Font Style</td>
<td>Font style can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Invert/Brightness</td>
<td>Brightness of the display or invert (white text on black background) is a specific option within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sepia</td>
<td>A sepia background (beige/mild yellow) is a specific option within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sliders/Colour</td>
<td>A selection of colours or Red/Green/Blue sliders allow the user to adjust and specify the background colour within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pinch zoom</td>
<td>The pinch zoom is a built-in function of the iOS. Some apps do not make/allow full use of this touch-based function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS Speak Selection</td>
<td>A function which can be enabled in the General &gt; Accessibility functions in the iOS this can be used by selecting text in certain apps and pressing the 'speak' option which comes up. This is distinct from the 'Voiceover' option which is a complete audio interface and harder use for quick impromptu needs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The scores as an embedded Google Spreadsheet - a work in progress. NB: this list is not designed to be exhaustive and if you have other apps which you would like me to assess using these criteria, please add them to the comments area below. The ""+"" next to the app title identifies that the app is available for both iPhone and iPad.

<strong>Conclusion
</strong>Through this process of investigation and app functionality testing I feel that I have only begun to scrape the surface of how accessibility functions are implemented and the possible avenues for improvement. I think that there is certainly scope to devise a more concrete scoring and testing system with the view to helping teachers and learners make informed decisions about the accessibility functions of certain apps. Such a system would also have the potential to help inform developers about the needs of specific user groups. However the responsibility cannot be squarely that of the developers, as users we also have a responsibility to let developers know what we want and need. One of the benefits of working with apps is that developers are often small to medium sized companies and really benefit from the suggestions from their user-base, this may extend to use testing. In the <em>Wild West</em> of apps we as the user have an opportunity to make a difference and we shouldn't miss out by sticking to the easy path.

<strong>Sharing what I have learned thus far from building my child theme</strong>
Mark Joste from the DMP PG programme invited me to join his project site&nbsp;<a href=""https://community.brighton.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">community.brighton.ac.uk</a>&lt;fn&gt;University of Brighton's Digital Award winning project&lt;/fn&gt; as part of an&nbsp;Accessibility special interest group. <em>Community</em> is based on WordPress, it felt like a good opportunity to share what I learned about the WP Accessibility plugin and the best settings for it's configuration. Mark is testing it out prior to deployment.
<strong>Have a project meeting on Wednesday
</strong>I have arranged a meeting with Dr. Fotis who has been away on a research trip. I plan to show him the designs and prototypes thus far and to iron out exactly what will need to go into the patient journey. I also need to find out more about the target audiences for the infographic/site as I don't know enough to come up with a basic set of characteristics (beyond what I have outlined&nbsp;already in the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nxisu8BaAGM3iaJ1r7oZv4b-XAM59ZMapdnNgK0rQzc/edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">task scenarios</a> and <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">concept</a>). I am also working on a higher fidelity prototype&nbsp;in Photoshop prior to meeting him. If time allows I may well make the prototype slightly more interactive in <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/experience-design.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adobe Experience Design</a> or <a href=""https://www.invisionapp.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">InVision</a> prior to our meeting. All of this feels like jumping ahead a bit, but this is necessary due to the structure of the project. As a general rule I learn by doing, so I have to set myself goals as I go along. You'll notice that I have dispensed with the paper prototype idea from the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>concept&nbsp;</em>journal entry</a>; I need to get further ahead than that so that I can actually 'build' a web-based project.
<strong>Wireframing</strong>
I did look at some wireframing tools, such as <a href=""https://balsamiq.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Balsamiq</a>, <a href=""https://wireframe.cc/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wireframe.cc</a>, <a href=""https://www.axure.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Axure</a>&lt;fn&gt;This one is definitely worth a more in-depth look over winter break in preparation for my final project.&lt;/fn&gt; and <a href=""https://www.mockflow.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MockFlow</a>. Once again though I found myself returning to my <a href=""https://rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_dotPad.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Rhodia dotpad</a>&lt;fn&gt;&lt;/fn&gt;&nbsp;and Adobe Photoshop for the wireframe and CSS grid planning. It just feels unencumbered and organised both visually and to an extent mathematically. <a href=""https://www.lucidchart.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Lucidchart</a> is certainly my tool of choice when it comes to UML diagrams, site maps, flow charts and task lists. Again, if I do decide to create a UML diagram&lt;fn&gt;Another to-do that I set for myself in the <a href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2016/10/23/portfolio-site-concept-and-other-news/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">concept post.</a>&lt;/fn&gt;, I can only do so once I have a better idea&nbsp;of what information&nbsp;to include in the patient journey.
<strong>Coding
</strong>I have been trying out&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WebStorm</a> alongside my old faithful <a href=""http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">TextWrangler</a> over the last few weeks as a complete solution for html, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I have to say I have been completely won over, especially since I hooked it up to my github repositories. It is actually a joy to use and alerts me to typing errors and possible syntax issues. I am delighted that it is available for free with a student email address.
<strong>Meetup
</strong>I attended the <a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Gamification-Meetup/events/234090387/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Brighton Gamification Meetup group on Wednesday</a> and was really inspired by some of the interface ideas that were discussed. Certainly worth bearing in mind in future, particularly The Manager's Path presented by<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Vasilis Gkogkidis (from Gamification+),<strong>&nbsp;</strong>which looks like a fantastic foray into self-tracking and self-betterment. I'll keep tabs on that as I consider the wearable app that I am looking to scope/design for my final degree project.
<strong>Development path this week
</strong>It seemed like the ideal time to move on from the ""firstedit1"" version of my prototype to a new branch, entitled ""portfolioprojv2"". I decided to use this new prototype as an excuse to&nbsp;update my CSS knowledge. Furthermore, after discussion with Marcus on Friday and testing on a PC this week, it seems that trying to make the site work in Internet Explorer is a no-go. I am finding that even with vanilla javascript, many simple features/functions that I want to add do not function at all in Internet Explorer 9. So what I will need to do is work on a more IE friendly version of the infographic in the future, but in terms of the assignment I need to focus on what will work in the majority of modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera&nbsp;and Edge). I will talk to Dr. Fotis about this as well, as undoubtedly some of these lovely British Medical Journal infographics don't work well in IE either: <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/infographics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.bmj.com/infographics</a>&nbsp;(thus my logical conclusion is that doctors might not view media-rich content at work in IE).
<strong>Navigation
</strong>I really think that the scrolling function, as discussed in previous posts is good. However, it was clear that&nbsp;the function needed to be refined. Alas, as outlined above the function doesn't work at all in Internet Explorer 9. I also felt that if I were navigating this site, I may run out of time at some point in the patient story and want to skip to another area of the site, so some sort of navigation always needs to be available. So I started to think about what might be possible. I drew some inspiration from the fix top-bar in the Gamification+ site (not shown in the mobile view of the site):&nbsp;<a href=""https://gamificationplus.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gamificationplus.uk/</a>
I started with a fixed position navigation that travelled down the page as you scrolled. This was based on month of the story. However,&nbsp;conceptually I started to have difficulty with dates and months, as it may feel too constricted and also unrealistic (or worse still idealistic) for the audience. I decided that it would be better&nbsp;to structure the timeline aspect&nbsp;around activities that take place in-time; as due to a collection of possibly delaying factors who knows <em>when</em> our fictional patient's operation will actually take place. The positioning also ran counter to established navigation design patterns and would likely confuse users.

[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1072""]<img style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/01navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 1"" width=""1072"" height=""612""> Nav test 1[/caption]

While I was still thinking about months. I also tried placing the months at the top of the page. You will notice that I added mock-up navigation for the future pages on the top-right as well. Although&nbsp;I have shifted my thinking on the items in the navigation - <strong>About</strong> is the same as the <strong>Patient</strong>; the patient is a fictional device to explain the project. <strong>About</strong> should actually be <strong>Team</strong>&nbsp;as we need to introduce the more about the team and&nbsp;the goals for the project.&nbsp;<strong>Devices</strong> can stay as-is as this will be used to describe potential device types and physiological measurements/sensors per device.

[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1072""]<img class=""size-medium"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/02navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 2"" width=""1072"" height=""621""> Nav test 2[/caption]

I kept the <strong>next</strong> buttons with the top navigation, as you can see from the screenshot below. However, after thinking on it, it really seemed like the&nbsp;<strong>next</strong> buttons were the most useful. Especially as they could offer more scope for styling later on and they allowed the user to progress through the timeline or steps of the patient story in a sequential way. Also in IE, if these buttons are hidden because the function is unavailable then the page will still have logical navigation based on either scrolling or using the arrow keys.

[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1070""]<img style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/03navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 2.5"" width=""1070"" height=""618""> Nav test 2.5[/caption]

In the end I liked the&nbsp;<strong>next</strong> buttons as shown below (at 100% width) and then some kind of floating page navigation on the top-right. I shall have to look at some design patterns and have a think about the best way of doing that.

[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""911""]<img style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 3"" width=""911"" height=""540""> Nav test 3[/caption]

Then after the first&nbsp;<strong>Next&nbsp;</strong>button is clicked&nbsp;here is how&nbsp;the next section of the prototype looks (see Nav test 3.5 below). There is a nice amount of area for information.

[caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""913""]<img class=""size-medium"" style=""border: solid 1px black;"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04_5navtest.png"" alt=""Screenshot of navigation test 3.5"" width=""913"" height=""607""> Nav test 3.5[/caption]

The next step is to create a CSS grid system to ensure that alignment is accurate (as you can see above the text is not placed correctly). I found <a href=""http://j4n.co/blog/Creating-your-own-css-grid-system"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this post&nbsp;about grid setup</a> and will refer to it and the <em>Implementing Responsive Design</em> book (Kadlec, 2013).
<h3><strong>More timeline examples</strong></h3>
I found <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/about"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this timeline by DuckDuckGo</a> and it has completed shifted my thinking in terms of what is possible with a combination a horizontal timeline and a vertical layout site. This could be a really good direction to take with the design. I love the deceivingly simple design&nbsp;and the content is also pleasingly responsive. Having dug into the coding a bit, I love that the timeline itself if actually composed from a series of squares with ""border-radius: 100%"" in the CSS. No IE9 support and it is CSS3, sitting at just over 93% supported (according to caniuse.com:&nbsp;<a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=border-ra"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://caniuse.com/#search=border-ra</a>). If Dr. Fotis likes this layout then I shall look at whether I can adapt what I have so far to a horizontal layout with targets&lt;fn&gt;It is really hard to tell what DuckDuckGo are doing in terms of the .js I can't tell which library they are using, if any.&lt;/fn&gt;. My only criticism with this timeline is that you want to click on the <em>year</em> bubbles and they do not do anything.

<h4><strong>A journey down the wrong path</strong></h4>
I investigated using javascript to dynamically resize the the coloured box sections based on browser window size. I thought this would be a good plan as I want the&nbsp;<strong>next</strong> buttons to appear in the same place on the page regardless of screen/window size.&nbsp;It became apparent that this was not the correct approach and&nbsp;having spent a reasonable amount of time pursuing it. JQuery
Here are a few things that I found along the way.
Textarea auto resize vanilla javascript - this could well be useful in the future:&nbsp;<a href=""https://gist.github.com/ugin/5779160"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gist.github.com/ugin/5779160</a>
This is sort of cool, but I am not sure of when/if I would need it (removing, resizing and snapping windows):&nbsp;<a href=""https://codepen.io/zz85/post/resizing-moving-snapping-windows-with-js-css"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://codepen.io/zz85/post/resizing-moving-snapping-windows-with-js-css</a>
Tried to use querySelectorAll&nbsp;but couldn't get it working correctly:
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll</a>
box-sizing - I just found out more about this which was helpful and spent some time checking out Marcus' example responsive site:
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing
</a>Marcus' example: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://itsuite.it.brighton.ac.uk/mw159/demo/responsive/
</a>I realised that I definitely needed a border-box due to everything needing to be inside the box! At close to 98% supported, that isn't too bad (<a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=border-box"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://caniuse.com/#search=border-box</a>).
Useful site that I found and believe Marcus also recommended, youmightnotneedsjquery.com:
<a href=""http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#outer_height"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#outer_height</a>
This is also a useful snippet to keep hold of for later as it could be helpful for calculations. I tried it in the Google Chrome console:
<a href=""https://gist.github.com/joshcarr/2f861bd37c3d0df40b30"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gist.github.com/joshcarr/2f861bd37c3d0df40b30

What I was aiming to&nbsp;write was something along the lines of this: <a href=""https://coderwall.com/p/czodeg/set-width-and-height-based-on-viewport-dimentions-vanilla-javascript"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://coderwall.com/p/czodeg/set-width-and-height-based-on-viewport-dimentions-vanilla-javascript</a>
Also I found this, which might be&nbsp;handy to keep for later:
<a href=""https://css-tricks.com/scaled-proportional-blocks-with-css-and-javascript/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://css-tricks.com/scaled-proportional-blocks-with-css-and-javascript/</a>
This led me to find out more about window.innerHeight: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight</a>
I ended up using viewport height (""vh"") for now but&nbsp;it might not be a robust solution at only <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=vh"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">82.55% support</a> (at the time of writing). It is CSS3 value and will&nbsp;have some compatibility issues: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1575141/make-div-100-height-of-browser-window"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1575141/make-div-100-height-of-browser-window</a>

<h3>The ultimate prioritisation list</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An intense re-focusing meant that we were able to work with a clearly defined technical toolset in a really efficient way. We also shifted to a more agile CMS in the interest of getting information out quickly via targetted microsites (Wordpress Blogs). Under normal circumstances the requirement to use standard platforms and administrative processes take precedence, but there was no time for that. As a consequence within a short space of time a relevant, fresh and living set of resources were built to support teaching as it exists right 'now'. </p>

<p>The aforementioned set of resources, are out in the world as open educational resources which feels more important than ever in the time of COVID-19. When my Frequently Asked Questions for Microsoft Teams could make a difference for a primary school teacher without a learning technologist - that means a lot to my professionally and personally. This is why I got into this field and over recent years I have noticed a growing tendency for learning technologies information to be squirrelled away, hopefully the trend may start to wane moving forward.</p>

<h3>Answering the right questions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Referring back to my Frequently Asked Questions though, that is not to say that I myself am reinventing the wheel, I am linking to materials which technology vendors such as Microsoft and Blackboard have provided. I already valued these resources which have improved in quantity and quality over recent years. However, a key role of a learning technologist is to know how to contextualise these answers by answering localised questions. Essentially joining up the dots between the question asked, the language used to ask the question, the technology and the language it uses to describe itself. So we add grand adviser-integrator-augmenter-<em>translators</em><strong> </strong>to our list. I think now more than ever I value and acknowledge the open resources provided by vendors and other universities across the world.</p>

<h3>A new conception of time</h3>

<p>Due to the sheer volume of work coming in for a brief time the shape of my job changed. I was in a sort of rapid creation mode during the first three weeks of lockdown. This 'mode' was at turns the most productive and stressful experience of my learning technologies career and was certainly more akin to the adrenaline highs of my previous vocation as a artist and curator; like the feeling of the hours leading up to an opening night. This productivity was supported by a conscious filter where my clients knew I was busy so instead of asking me a question in the first instance, would attempt to find the answer on their own or sought support centrally from the service desk. This was a new situation for me. I like being known as a solutions person, a go-to person, but it suddenly dawned on me that because I am available and take pride in providing a quality service sometimes this means that I my own productivity and wellbeing are put on the back-burner. With fewer help calls and more efficient means of answering the questions that were coming in (I'll come to that later), I suddenly had the mental focus I needed to develop two new teaching sessions. I had the necessary time free of interruption to think hard about showcasing best practice in the session designs and this was a wonderful feeling. Finally I had some head-space and because I was producing enough to meet my own self-imposed goals, I got to have lunches away from my desk for the first time in years. <br><br>There is a piece of learning here for me to take away and ruminate on. My role has since reverted back to something more reactive on the day-to-day. However, I am going to proactively consider how I can reach a better state of equilibrium so that I can have blocks of work free of interruption.</p>

<p>This post is a personal reflection in response to a question posed by <a href=""https://twitter.com/TomEduTrainer"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Tom Langston</a> on Twitter as a retweet of <a href=""https://twitter.com/CleggDr"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr Andy Clegg</a>. Observing that other individuals tagged in the tweet<sup>1 </sup>have more involvement in policy and management, I was both humbled and interested in why my opinion might be sought. Thank you for asking Tom! To provide some context I have been working as a learning technologist for almost 10 years and my perspective comes from that space: the direct solution space. Although I am occasionally consulted on policy decisions I am rarely a decision maker and I do not manage people, I do 'own' or manage systems. In addition to my learning technologist 'hat', I am an accessibility advocate and a trained User Experience researcher. I am passionate about inclusive design, moral transparency and pragmatic teaching and learning.</p>

<h2>Entering lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it became clear that lockdown would be our new reality; decisions had to be made and actioned rapidly. It also became clear that learning technology expertise was a valuable commodity. As a discipline we were suddenly placed at the centre of supporting the continuation of teaching practice, as opposed to our previous position as the grand adviser-integrator-augmenters. I praise my own managers during the lead-up to and final situation of lockdown, who made quick and clear decisions with regard to which tools would be used, and for what tasks in the emergency teaching situation.</p>

<h2>Observations during lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am going to define these as loose observations at this point as I do not yet have the benefit of hindsight. However, I do believe it is important to record your own thinking at a given point in time even if ultimately circumstances end up proving your wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>The ultimate prioritisation list</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An intense re-focusing meant that we were able to work with a clearly defined technical toolset in a really efficient way. We also shifted to a more agile CMS in the interest of getting information out quickly via targetted microsites (Wordpress Blogs). Under normal circumstances the requirement to use standard platforms and administrative processes take precedence, but there was no time for that. As a consequence within a short space of time a relevant, fresh and living set of resources were built to support teaching as it exists right 'now'. </p>

<p>The aforementioned set of resources, are out in the world as open educational resources which feels more important than ever in the time of COVID-19. When my Frequently Asked Questions for Microsoft Teams could make a difference for a primary school teacher without a learning technologist - that means a lot to my professionally and personally. This is why I got into this field and over recent years I have noticed a growing tendency for learning technologies information to be squirrelled away, hopefully the trend may start to wane moving forward. On a technical level, a small but important innovation on our informational site was adding the power of ad-free Google search so that the answers to questions could be found more easily.</p>

<h3>Answering the right questions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Referring back to my Frequently Asked Questions, that is not to say that I myself am reinventing the wheel, I am linking to materials which technology vendors such as Microsoft and Blackboard have provided. I already valued these resources which have improved in quantity and quality over recent years. However, a key role of a learning technologist is to know how to contextualise these answers by answering localised questions. Essentially joining up the dots between the question asked, the language used to ask the question, the technology and the language it uses to describe itself. So we add grand adviser-integrator-augmenter-<em>translators</em><strong> </strong>to our list. I think now more than ever I value and acknowledge the open resources provided by vendors and other universities across the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>A new conception of time</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the sheer volume of work coming in for a brief time the shape of my job changed. I was in a sort of rapid creation mode during the first three weeks of lockdown. This 'mode' was at turns the most productive and stressful experience of my learning technologies career and was certainly more akin to the adrenaline highs of my previous vocation as a artist and curator; like the feeling of the hours leading up to an opening night. This productivity was supported by a conscious filter where my clients knew I was busy so instead of asking me a question in the first instance, would attempt to find the answer on their own or sought support centrally from the service desk. This was a new situation for me. I like being known as a solutions person, a go-to person, but it suddenly dawned on me that because I am available and take pride in providing a quality service sometimes this means that I my own productivity and wellbeing are put on the back-burner. With fewer help calls and more efficient means of answering the questions that were coming in (I'll come to that later), I suddenly had the mental focus I needed to develop two new teaching sessions. I had the necessary time free of interruption to think hard about showcasing best practice in the session designs and this was a wonderful feeling. Finally I had some head-space and because I was producing enough to meet my own self-imposed goals, I got to have lunches away from my desk for the first time in years. <br><br>There is a piece of learning here for me to take away and ruminate on. My role has since reverted back to something more reactive on the day-to-day. However, I am going to proactively consider how I can reach a better state of equilibrium so that I can have blocks of work free of interruption.</p>

This tension has always existed in my work, between proactive and reactive, but I do think that in the longer term a project-based workflow more akin to development work, with Agile<sup>1</sup> sprints accompanied by service models which support fewer interruptions may be positive. When you are in a service role there can be an intense feeling of guilt when you have taken an hour to work on workshop preparation and have 30 emails - even 'quick' questions at this volume consume work time.</p>

<h3>Resourcefulness vs. idiosyncrasy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the downsides users sourcing of their own solutions is that the local setup does not always match the technology developer's ideal. For example, folks find exciting help guides which suggest that they can schedule MS Teams meetings via their calendar. These features are not available due to differences in the local setup and this means that some of a learning technologist's job is about tempering expectations. It does point to the end of branding and idiosyncrasy. To support more as learning technologists we potentially need to have fewer home-grown elements and this means that branding the VLE/ePortfolio/[insert eLearning tool here] is not as sustainable as it was in the past. This is also true due to the frequency of updates. Vendors are far more responsive to suggestions from users and interfaces change at a steady rate making it tricky to stay on-top of help documentation especially when in a continuous delivery, Software-as-a-Service model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the notion of home-grown, I would add 'fudger' to my definition of a learning technologist: adviser-integrator-augmenter-translators-<em>fudger</em>. A learning technologist has MacGuyver abilities for sure, to transmute existing technologies to fit a need for which the technology was not originally designed. At any given time I am managing and sustaining so many of these 'solutions'. With the increased demand the 'paper clips' have started to slip and I have come to realise that this is hidden work which could and should be managed using the correct tools. All of these fudges might actually be more expensive in terms of time expenditure than working on a more holistic solution. Furthermore when <em>fudges</em> are applied in the learning space, rather than say an administrative space, they can lack digital authenticity as in they using a tool designed for one thing as another. This may differ from students' broader experiences of technology and cause a level of dissatisfaction; a square peg.</p>

<h3>Online learning?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up until recently, I would refer to the excellent article in the <a href=""https://er.educause.edu/articles/2020/3/the-difference-between-emergency-remote-teaching-and-online-learning""><em>Educause Review</em> by Hodges <em>et al.</em> (2020)</a> and say that we have been ""emergency remote teaching"" rather than producing online learning. Having said that this is now shifting in a very exciting way and the hybridised designs that I am starting to see for future teaching demonstrate astounding progress in a short time. Part of the challenge of redesign of teaching and delivery is that there is no longer a default. The defaults before were: just do whatever it is in-person, or print it out and give it to people. I cannot tell you how many times I advised on technology and even helped to setup a solution to hear that the person got worried and returned to the 'safe' solution of in-person oft to never revisit the technology again. This is no longer an option and it <em>is </em>scary. The closest that we have to a default is the VLE and sometimes I have to remind people that it exists amongst all the <em>new </em>and shiny; it is our dependable pal.</p>

<h3>Experience at the picnic blanket level</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly interactions and micro-interactions are gaining importance and this is a very good thing. I have been using Charles and Ray Eames 1977 video for IBM as an analogy for this in teaching. Suddenly the focus has changed, the clicks are important, the minutes are important in the hours of a day of teaching content. This is so important because although as educators we cannot complete with the attention to detail of micro-interactions in your average software application, like designers we are creating an experience and every interaction is part of that experience. </p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>This post is a personal reflection in response to a question posed by <a href=""https://twitter.com/TomEduTrainer"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Tom Langston</a> on Twitter as a retweet of <a href=""https://twitter.com/CleggDr"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr Andy Clegg</a>. Observing that other individuals tagged in the tweet have more involvement in policy and management, I was both humbled and interested in why my opinion might be sought. Thank you for asking Tom!</p>
<p>To provide some context I have been working as a learning technologist for almost 10 years and my perspective comes from that space: the direct solution space. Although I am occasionally consulted on policy decisions I am rarely a decision maker and I do not manage people, I do manage systems as a product owner of sorts. In addition to my learning technologist 'hat', I am an accessibility advocate and a trained User Experience researcher. I am passionate about inclusive design, moral transparency and pragmatic teaching and learning.</p>

<h2>Entering lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it became clear that lockdown would be our new reality; decisions had to be made and actioned rapidly. It also became clear that learning technology expertise was a valuable commodity. As a discipline we were suddenly placed at the centre of supporting the continuation of teaching practice, as opposed to our previous position as the grand adviser-integrator-augmenters. I praise my own managers during the lead-up to and final situation of lockdown, who made quick and clear decisions with regard to which tools would be used, and for what tasks in the emergency teaching situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Observations during lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am going to define these as loose observations at this point as I do not yet have the benefit of hindsight. However, I do believe it is important to record your own thinking at a given point in time even if, ultimately circumstances end up proving you wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>The ultimate prioritisation list</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An intense re-focusing meant that we were able to work with a clearly defined technical toolset in an efficient way. We also shifted to a more agile CMS in the interest of getting information out quickly via targetted microsites (Wordpress Blogs). Under normal circumstances the requirement to use standard platforms and administrative processes take precedence, but there was no time for that. As a consequence within a short space of time a relevant, fresh and 'living' set of resources were built to support teaching as it exists right 'now'. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Sharing is caring</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aforementioned set of resources, are out in the world as open educational resources which feels more important than ever in the time of COVID-19. When my Frequently Asked Questions for Microsoft Teams could make a difference for a primary school teacher without a learning technologist - that means a lot to me professionally and personally. This is why I got into this field and over recent years I have noticed a growing tendency for learning technologies information to be squirrelled away. Hopefully this trend may start to wane moving forward. On a technical level, a small but important innovation on our information site was adding the power of ad-free Google search so that the answers to questions could be found more easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Answering the right questions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Referring back to my Frequently Asked Questions, that is not to say that I myself am reinventing the wheel, I am linking to materials which technology vendors such as Microsoft and Blackboard have provided. I already valued these resources which have improved in quantity and quality over recent years. However, a key role of a learning technologist is to know how to contextualise these answers by answering localised questions. Essentially joining up the dots between the question asked, the language used to ask the question, and the language that technology uses to describe itself. So we add grand adviser-integrator-augmenter-<em>translators</em><strong> </strong>to our list. I think now more than ever I value and acknowledge the open resources provided by vendors and other universities across the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>A new conception of time</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the sheer volume of work coming in for a brief time the shape of my job changed. I was in a sort of rapid creation mode during the first three weeks of lockdown. This 'mode' was at turns the most productive and stressful experience of my learning technologies career and was certainly more akin to the adrenaline highs of my previous vocation as a artist and curator; like the feeling of the hours leading up to an opening night. This productivity was supported by a conscious filter where my clients knew I was busy so instead of asking me a question in the first instance, would attempt to find the answer on their own or sought support centrally from a service desk. This was a new situation for me. I like being known as a solutions person, a go-to person, but it suddenly dawned on me that because I am available and take pride in providing a quality service sometimes this means that my own productivity and wellbeing are put on the back-burner. With fewer help calls and more efficient means of answering the questions that were coming in (I'll come to that later), I suddenly had the mental focus I needed to develop two new teaching sessions. I had time free of interruption to think hard about showcasing best practice in the session designs and this was a wonderful feeling. Finally I had some head-space and because I was producing enough work to meet my own self-imposed goals, I got to have lunches away from my desk for the first time in years. <br><br>There is a piece of learning here for me to take away and ruminate on. My role has since reverted back to something more reactive on the day-to-day. However, I am going to consider how I can reach a better state of equilibrium so that I can have blocks of work free of interruption. This tension has always existed in my work, between proactive and reactive, but I do think that in the longer term a project-based workflow more akin to development work, with Agile<sup>1</sup> sprints accompanied by service models which support fewer interruptions may be positive. When you are in a service role there can be an intense feeling of guilt when you have taken an hour to work on workshop preparation and have 30 emails - even 'quick' questions at this volume consume work time.</p>

<h3>Chat is my new best friend</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thinking of those 'quick' questions, I am pleased that HE is finally starting to adopt chat-based tools. I had been using <a href=""https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Slack</a> for UX professional networking for a number of years and looked forward to the day when a similar solution would be part of my LX work. COVID-19 has hastened this change in work practice and although only a small numbers of my clients use it so far, where it is used it is far more efficient. The tendency to write emails-as-treatise in academia is still quite prevalent and when I have found myself sliding into this habit (e.g. >10mins composing an email), I have saved the email as a note and called the person instead. If you can do this too, your learning technologist will thank you (trust me!). Also as a dyslexic, I have often been concerned about how I perceived via the medium of email. Emails end up being more like letters, language and vocabulary can be judged. Furthermore, my tendency to forget words from sentences as my brain works faster than my personal language centres has been a perpetual source of self-critique. With chat I can write the answer with less fear and can always correct a spelling or add a word after the fact. It makes solutions faster and language less precious.</p>

It is easier to smooth these things over when you are teaching in-person, harder when the interaction is front-and-centre and it doesn't <em>feel</em> like the right solution.</p>

<h2>The Corridor Effect™️</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Corridor Effect™️ may not be the final title of this phenomena, I am still considering it, because really it is about the lack of corridors. Think about how much information we glean from colleagues in corridors, how those encounters build social cohesion and provide other perspectives and most importantly differing interpretations of information. Right now we are all in our own bubbles and this can profoundly affect some students who find locating and prioritising information difficult. They may have relied on the organisation and perception of others to stay up-to-date before. That is no longer an option, unless we build in these opportunities. Discussion boards, encouragement of study groups, specific support groups for some students; all of these approaches and more can be used and must be used. The consequence of not doing so means that the gap between those who understand the rules of academic game and those who are still learning how to play will exponentially grow.</p>

<h3>Teaching with empathy<sup>2</sup></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that as educators, now more than ever we need to think deeply about the experience of engaging with learning as a journey. For us, we may have travelled this particular learning path many times; we may have taught the same content over successive iterations of a course/module. For the students it is most likely their first time and add to that the current, personal, professional and societal challenges and undoubtedly this is a big ask. I have seen some amazing examples of empathetic, yet still rigorous teaching over the past few months and despite the challenges currently facing Higher Education internationally, this gives me hope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This post is an unabashed summary of my ideas, perhaps fledging ideas, and I do not doubt that these ideas have surfaced elsewhere in educational theory. However, I feel that sometimes writing from experience and considering how something exists and feels at a given time is a valuable endeavour and I plan to test and revisit these notions in the months-to-come. Thank you for reading.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><sup>1</sup><a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"" target=""_blank"">Agile</a> is not a panacea, it is imperfect. However, I have had a glimpse of a new world of productivity and personally believe that problems should be viewed as a dataset rather than our raison d'etre as a profession. We will not be able to respond to the ongoing demands of this crisis if we are stretched in too many different directions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><sup>2</sup>Empathy is a term that has been overused in design, but it is a term which has never been more relevant when used in its truest sense. Empty empathy when used in a purely semantic sense is worse than none. True empathy is about taking time to think deeply about the path as it is travelled by others. For more on this, I highly recommend reading the designer, <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://indiyoung.com/pubs-apps/"" target=""_blank"">Indi Young's writing</a>.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the downsides users sourcing of their own solutions is that the local setup does not always match the technology developer's ideal. For example, folks find exciting help guides which suggest that they can schedule MS Teams meetings via their calendar. These features are not available due to differences in the local setup and this means that some of a learning technologist's job is about tempering expectations. It does point to the end of branding and idiosyncrasy. To support more as learning technologists we potentially need to have fewer home-grown elements and this means that branding the VLE/ePortfolio/[insert eLearning tool here] is not as sustainable as it was in the past. This is also true due to the frequency of updates. Vendors are far more responsive to suggestions from users and interfaces change at a steady rate making it tricky to stay on-top of help documentation especially when in a continuous delivery, Software-as-a-Service model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the notion of home-grown, I would add 'fudger' to my definition of a learning technologist: adviser-integrator-augmenter-translators-<em>fudger</em>. A learning technologist has MacGyver abilities for sure, <a href=""https://er.educause.edu/articles/2020/3/the-difference-between-emergency-remote-teaching-and-online-learning"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Hodges <em>et al.</em> (2020)</a> also make this analogy, to transmute existing technologies to fit a need for which the technology was not originally designed. At any given time I am managing and sustaining so many of these 'solutions'. With the increased demand for my services, the 'paper clips' have started to slip and I have come to realise that this is hidden work which could and should be managed using specialist tools. All of these <em>fudges</em> might actually be more expensive in terms of time expenditure than working on a more holistic solution. Furthermore when <em>fudges</em> are applied in the learning space, rather than say an administrative space, they can lack digital authenticity as in using a tool designed for one thing as another. The experience of using such a solution may differ from students' broader experiences of technology and cause a level of dissatisfaction; a square peg. It is easier to smooth these things over when you are teaching in-person, harder when the interaction is front-and-centre and it doesn't <em>feel</em> like the right solution.</p>

<h3>Online learning?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up until recently, I would refer to the excellent article in the <a href=""https://er.educause.edu/articles/2020/3/the-difference-between-emergency-remote-teaching-and-online-learning""><em>Educause Review</em> by Hodges <em>et al.</em> (2020)</a> and say that we have been ""emergency remote teaching"" rather than producing online learning. Having said that this is now shifting in a very exciting way and the hybridised designs that I am starting to see for future teaching demonstrate astounding progress in a short time. Part of the challenge of redesign of teaching and delivery is that there is no longer a default. The defaults before were: just do whatever it is in-person, or print it out and give it to people. I cannot tell you how many times I advised on technology and even helped to setup a solution to hear that the person got worried and returned to the 'safe' solution of in-person oft to never revisit the technology again. This is no longer an option and it <em>is </em>scary. The closest that we have to a default is the VLE and sometimes I have to remind people that it exists amongst all the <em>new </em>and shiny; it is our dependable pal.</p>

<h3>Experience at the picnic blanket level</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly interactions and micro-interactions are gaining importance and this is a very good thing. I have been using Charles and Ray Eames <em>Powers of Ten </em>video for IBM (1977) as an analogy for this in teaching. Suddenly the focus has changed, we are at the picnic blanket level. The clicks are important, the minutes are important in the hours of a day of teaching content. This is key because although as educators we cannot compete with the attention-to-detail that UI/UX designers apply to micro-interactions in software applications, but like designers we are creating an experience and every interaction is part of that experience. </p>

<h2>The Corridor Effect™️</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Corridor Effect™️ may not be the final title of this phenomena, I am still considering it, because really it is about the lack of corridors. Think about how much information we glean from colleagues in corridors, how those encounters build social cohesion and provide other perspectives and most importantly differing interpretations of information. Right now we are all in our own bubbles and this can profoundly affect some students who find locating and prioritising information difficult. They may have relied on the organisation and perception of others to stay up-to-date before. That is no longer an option, unless we build in these opportunities. Discussion boards, encouragement of study groups, specific support groups for some students; all of these approaches and more can be used and must be used. The consequence of not doing so means that the gap between those who understand the rules of academic game and those who are still learning how to play will exponentially grow.</p>

<h3>Teaching with empathy<sup>2</sup></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that as educators, now more than ever we need to think deeply about the experience of engaging with learning as a journey. For us, we may have travelled this particular learning path many times; we may have taught the same content over successive iterations of a course/module. For the students it is most likely their first time and add to that the current personal, professional and societal challenges and undoubtedly this is a big ask. I have seen some amazing examples of empathetic, yet rigorous, teaching over the past few months and despite the challenges currently facing Higher Education internationally, this gives me hope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This post is an unabashed summary of my ideas, perhaps fledging ideas, and I do not doubt that these ideas have surfaced elsewhere in educational theory. However, I feel that sometimes writing from experience and considering how something exists and feels at a given time is a valuable endeavour and I plan to test and revisit these notions in the months-to-come. Thank you for reading.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><sup>1</sup><a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"" target=""_blank"">Agile</a> is not a panacea, it is imperfect. However, I have had a glimpse of a new world of productivity and personally believe that problems should be viewed as a dataset rather than our raison d'etre as a profession. We will not be able to respond to the ongoing demands of this crisis if we are stretched in too many different directions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><sup>2</sup>Empathy is a term that has been overused in design, but it is a term which has never been more relevant when used in its truest sense. Empty empathy when used in a purely semantic sense is worse than none. True empathy is about taking time to think deeply about the path as it is travelled by others. For more on this, I highly recommend reading the designer, <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://indiyoung.com/pubs-apps/"" target=""_blank"">Indi Young's writing</a>.</p>

<p>This post is a personal reflection in response to a question posed by <a href=""https://twitter.com/TomEduTrainer"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Tom Langston</a> on Twitter as a retweet of <a href=""https://twitter.com/CleggDr"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr Andy Clegg</a>. Observing that other individuals tagged in the tweet have more involvement in policy and management, I was both humbled and interested in why my opinion might be sought. Thank you for asking Tom!</p>
<p>To provide some context I have been working as a learning technologist for almost 10 years and my perspective comes from that space: the direct solution space. Although I am occasionally consulted on policy decisions I am rarely a decision maker and I do not manage people, I do manage systems as a product owner of sorts. In addition to my learning technologist 'hat', I am an accessibility advocate and a trained User Experience researcher. I am passionate about inclusive design, moral transparency and pragmatic teaching and learning.</p>

<h2>Entering lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it became clear that lockdown would be our new reality; decisions had to be made and actioned rapidly. It also became clear that learning technology expertise was a valuable commodity. As a discipline we were suddenly placed at the centre of supporting the continuation of teaching practice, as opposed to our previous position as the grand adviser-integrator-augmenters. I praise my own managers during the lead-up to and final situation of lockdown, who made quick and clear decisions with regard to which tools would be used, and for what tasks in the emergency teaching situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Observations during lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am going to define these as loose observations at this point as I do not yet have the benefit of hindsight. However, I do believe it is important to record your own thinking at a given point in time even if, ultimately circumstances end up proving you wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>The ultimate prioritisation list</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An intense re-focusing meant that we were able to work with a clearly defined technical toolset in an efficient way. We also shifted to a more agile CMS in the interest of getting information out quickly via targetted microsites (Wordpress Blogs). Under normal circumstances the requirement to use standard platforms and administrative processes take precedence, but there was no time for that. As a consequence within a short space of time a relevant, fresh and 'living' set of resources were built to support teaching as it exists right 'now'. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Sharing is caring</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aforementioned set of resources, are out in the world as open educational resources which feels more important than ever in the time of COVID-19. When my Frequently Asked Questions for Microsoft Teams could make a difference for a primary school teacher without a learning technologist - that means a lot to me professionally and personally. This is why I got into this field and over recent years I have noticed a growing tendency for learning technologies information to be squirrelled away. Hopefully this trend may start to wane moving forward. On a technical level, a small but important innovation on our information site was adding the power of ad-free Google search so that the answers to questions could be found more easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Answering the right questions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Referring back to my Frequently Asked Questions, that is not to say that I myself am reinventing the wheel, I am linking to materials which technology vendors such as Microsoft and Blackboard have provided. I already valued these resources which have improved in quantity and quality over recent years. However, a key role of a learning technologist is to know how to contextualise these answers by answering localised questions. Essentially joining up the dots between the question asked, the language used to ask the question, and the language that technology uses to describe itself. So we add grand adviser-integrator-augmenter-<em>translators</em><strong> </strong>to our list. I think now more than ever I value and acknowledge the open resources provided by vendors and other universities across the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>A new conception of time</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the sheer volume of work coming in for a brief time the shape of my job changed. I was in a sort of rapid creation mode during the first three weeks of lockdown. This 'mode' was at turns the most productive and stressful experience of my learning technologies career and was certainly more akin to the adrenaline highs of my previous vocation as a artist and curator; like the feeling of the hours leading up to an opening night. This productivity was supported by a conscious filter where my clients knew I was busy so instead of asking me a question in the first instance, would attempt to find the answer on their own or sought support centrally from a service desk. This was a new situation for me. I like being known as a solutions person, a go-to person, but it suddenly dawned on me that because I am available and take pride in providing a quality service sometimes this means that my own productivity and wellbeing are put on the back-burner. With fewer help calls and more efficient means of answering the questions that were coming in (I'll come to that later), I suddenly had the mental focus I needed to develop two new teaching sessions. I had time free of interruption to think hard about showcasing best practice in the session designs and this was a wonderful feeling. Finally I had some head-space and because I was producing enough work to meet my own self-imposed goals, I got to have lunches away from my desk for the first time in years. <br><br>There is a piece of learning here for me to take away and ruminate on. My role has since reverted back to something more reactive on the day-to-day. However, I am going to consider how I can reach a better state of equilibrium so that I can have blocks of work free of interruption. This tension has always existed in my work, between proactive and reactive, but I do think that in the longer term a project-based workflow more akin to development work, with Agile<sup><a href=""#agile"">1</a></sup> sprints accompanied by service models which support fewer interruptions may be positive. When you are in a service role there can be an intense feeling of guilt when you have taken an hour to work on workshop preparation and have 30 emails - even 'quick' questions at this volume consume work time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Chat is my new best friend</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thinking of those 'quick' questions, I am pleased that HE is finally starting to adopt chat-based tools. I had been using <a href=""https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Slack</a> for UX professional networking for a number of years and looked forward to the day when a similar solution would be part of my LX work. COVID-19 has hastened this change in work practice and although only a small numbers of my clients use it so far, where it is used it is far more efficient. The tendency to write emails-as-treatise in academia is still quite prevalent and when I have found myself sliding into this habit (e.g. >10mins composing an email), I have saved the email as a note and called the person instead. If you can do this too, your learning technologist will thank you (trust me!). Also as a dyslexic, I have often been concerned about how I perceived via the medium of email. Emails end up being more like letters, language and vocabulary can be judged. Furthermore, my tendency to forget words from sentences as my brain works faster than my personal language centres has been a perpetual source of self-critique. With chat I can write the answer with less fear and can always correct a spelling or add a word after the fact. It makes solutions faster and language less precious.</p>

<h3>The ultimate prioritisation list</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An intense re-focusing meant that we were able to work with a clearly defined technical toolset in an efficient way. We also shifted to a more agile CMS in the interest of getting information out quickly via targetted microsites (Wordpress Blogs). Under normal circumstances the requirement to use standard platforms and administrative processes take precedence, but there was no time for that. As a consequence within a short space of time a relevant, fresh and 'living' set of resources were built to support teaching as it exists right 'now'. </p>

<h3>Sharing is caring</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aforementioned set of resources, are out in the world as open educational resources which feels more important than ever in the time of COVID-19. When my Frequently Asked Questions for Microsoft Teams could make a difference for a primary school teacher without a learning technologist - that means a lot to me professionally and personally. This is why I got into this field and over recent years I have noticed a growing tendency for learning technologies information to be squirrelled away. Hopefully this trend may start to wane moving forward. On a technical level, a small but important innovation on our information site was adding the power of ad-free Google search so that the answers to questions could be found more easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Answering the right questions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Referring back to my Frequently Asked Questions, that is not to say that I myself am reinventing the wheel, I am linking to materials which technology vendors such as Microsoft and Blackboard have provided. I already valued these resources which have improved in quantity and quality over recent years. However, a key role of a learning technologist is to know how to contextualise these answers by answering localised questions. Essentially joining up the dots between the question asked, the language used to ask the question, and the language that technology uses to describe itself. So we add grand adviser-integrator-augmenter-<em>translators</em><strong> </strong>to our list. I think now more than ever I value and acknowledge the open resources provided by vendors and other universities across the world.</p>

<h3>A new conception of time</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the sheer volume of work coming in for a brief time the shape of my job changed. I was in a sort of rapid creation mode during the first three weeks of lockdown. This 'mode' was at turns the most productive and stressful experience of my learning technologies career and was certainly more akin to the adrenaline highs of my previous vocation as a artist and curator; like the feeling of the hours leading up to an opening night. This productivity was supported by a conscious filter where my clients knew I was busy so instead of asking me a question in the first instance, would attempt to find the answer on their own or sought support centrally from a service desk. This was a new situation for me. I like being known as a solutions person, a go-to person, but it suddenly dawned on me that because I am available and take pride in providing a quality service sometimes this means that my own productivity and wellbeing are put on the back-burner. With fewer help calls and more efficient means of answering the questions that were coming in (I'll come to that later), I suddenly had the mental focus I needed to develop two new teaching sessions. I had time free of interruption to think hard about showcasing best practice in the session designs and this was a wonderful feeling. Finally I had some head-space and because I was producing enough work to meet my own self-imposed goals, I got to have lunches away from my desk for the first time in years. <br><br>There is a piece of learning here for me to take away and ruminate on. My role has since reverted back to something more reactive on the day-to-day. However, I am going to consider how I can reach a better state of equilibrium so that I can have blocks of work free of interruption. This tension has always existed in my work, between proactive and reactive, but I do think that in the longer term a project-based workflow more akin to development work, with Agile<sup><a href=""#agile"">1</a></sup> sprints accompanied by service models which support fewer interruptions may be positive. When you are in a service role there can be an intense feeling of guilt when you have taken an hour to work on workshop preparation and have 30 emails - even 'quick' questions at this volume consume work time.</p>

<h3>Chat is my new best friend</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thinking of those 'quick' questions, I am pleased that HE is finally starting to adopt chat-based tools. I had been using <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/"" target=""_blank"">Slack</a> for User Experience (UX) professional networking for a number of years and looked forward to the day when a similar solution would be part of my Learning <em>Experience</em> work. COVID-19 has hastened this change in work practice and although only a small numbers of my clients use it so far, where it is used it is far more efficient. The tendency to write emails-as-treatise in academia is still quite prevalent and when I have found myself sliding into this habit (e.g. >10mins composing an email), I have saved the email as a note and called the person instead. If you can do this too, your learning technologist will thank you (trust me!). Also as a dyslexic, I have often been concerned about how I perceived via the medium of email. Emails end up being more like letters, language and vocabulary can be judged. Furthermore, my tendency to forget words from sentences as my brain works faster than my personal language centres has been a perpetual source of self-critique. With chat I can write the answer with less fear and can always correct a spelling or add a word after the fact. It makes solutions faster and language less precious.</p>

<h3>Resourcefulness vs. idiosyncrasy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the downsides users sourcing of their own solutions is that the local setup does not always match the technology developer's ideal. For example, folks find exciting help guides which suggest that they can schedule MS Teams meetings via their calendar. These features are not available due to differences in the local setup and this means that some of a learning technologist's job is about tempering expectations. It does point to the end of branding and idiosyncrasy. To support more as learning technologists we potentially need to have fewer home-grown elements and this means that branding the VLE/ePortfolio/[insert eLearning tool here] is not as sustainable as it was in the past. This is also true due to the frequency of updates. Vendors are far more responsive to suggestions from users and interfaces change at a steady rate making it tricky to stay on-top of help documentation especially when in a continuous delivery, Software-as-a-Service model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the notion of home-grown, I would add 'fudger' to my definition of a learning technologist: adviser-integrator-augmenter-translator-<em>fudger</em>. A learning technologist has MacGyver abilities for sure, <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://er.educause.edu/articles/2020/3/the-difference-between-emergency-remote-teaching-and-online-learning"" target=""_blank"">Hodges <em>et al.</em> (2020)</a> also make this analogy, to transmute existing technologies to fit a need for which the technology was not originally designed. At any given time I am managing and sustaining so many of these 'solutions'. With the increased demand for my services, the 'paper clips' have started to slip and I have come to realise that this is hidden work which could and should be managed using specialist tools. All of these <em>fudges</em> might actually be more expensive in terms of time expenditure than working on a more holistic solution. Furthermore when <em>fudges</em> are applied in the learning space, rather than say an administrative space, they can lack digital authenticity as in using a tool designed for one thing as another. The experience of using such a solution may differ from students' broader experiences of technology and cause a level of dissatisfaction; a square peg. It is easier to smooth these things over when you are teaching in-person, harder when the interaction is front-and-centre and it doesn't <em>feel</em> like the right solution.</p>

<h3>Online learning?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up until recently, I quoted the excellent article in the <a href=""https://er.educause.edu/articles/2020/3/the-difference-between-emergency-remote-teaching-and-online-learning""><em>Educause Review</em> by Hodges <em>et al.</em> (2020)</a> and would say that we have been ""emergency remote teaching"" rather than producing online learning. Having said that, this is now shifting in a very exciting way, and the hybridised designs that I am starting to see for future teaching demonstrate astounding progress in a short time. Part of the challenge of redesign of teaching and delivery is that there is no longer a default. The defaults before were: just do whatever it is in-person, or print it out and give it to people. I cannot tell you how many times I advised on technology and even helped to setup a solution to hear that the person got worried and returned to the 'safe' solution of in-person oft to never revisit the technology again. This is no longer an option and it <em>is </em>scary. The closest that we have to a default is the VLE and sometimes I have to remind people that it exists amongst all the <em>new </em>and shiny; it is our dependable pal.</p>

<h3>Experience at the picnic blanket level</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly interactions and micro-interactions are gaining importance and this is a very good thing. I have been using Charles and Ray Eames <em>Powers of Ten </em>video for IBM (1977) as an analogy for this in teaching. Suddenly the focus has changed, we are at the picnic blanket level. The clicks are important, the minutes are important in the hours of a day of teaching content. This is key because although as educators we cannot compete with the attention-to-detail that UI/UX designers apply to micro-interactions in software applications, but like designers we are creating an experience and every interaction is part of that experience. </p>

<h2>The Corridor Effect™️</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Corridor Effect™️ may not be the final title of this phenomena, I am still considering it, because really it is about the lack of corridors. Think about how much information we glean from colleagues in corridors, how those encounters build social cohesion and provide other perspectives and most importantly differing interpretations of information. Right now we are all in our own bubbles and this can profoundly affect some students who find locating and prioritising information difficult. They may have relied on the organisation and perception of others to stay up-to-date before. That is no longer an option, unless we build in these opportunities. Discussion boards, encouragement of study groups, specific support groups for some students; all of these approaches and more can be used and must be used. The consequence of not doing so means that the gap between those who understand the rules of academic game and those who are still learning how to play will exponentially grow.</p>

<h3>Teaching with empathy<sup><a href=""#empathy"">2</a></sup></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that as educators, now more than ever we need to think deeply about the experience of engaging with learning as a journey. For us, we may have travelled this particular learning path many times; we may have taught the same content over successive iterations of a course/module. For the students it is most likely their first time and add to that the current personal, professional and societal challenges and undoubtedly this is a big ask. I have seen some amazing examples of empathetic, yet rigorous, teaching over the past few months and despite the challenges currently facing Higher Education internationally, this gives me hope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This post is an unabashed summary of my ideas, perhaps fledging ideas, and I do not doubt that these ideas have surfaced elsewhere in educational theory. However, I feel that sometimes writing from experience and considering how something exists and feels at a given time is a valuable endeavour and I plan to test and revisit these notions in the months-to-come. Thank you for reading.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><sup>1</sup><a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"" target=""_blank"">Agile</a> is not a panacea, it is imperfect. However, I have had a glimpse of a new world of productivity and personally believe that problems should be viewed as a dataset rather than our raison d'etre as a profession. We will not be able to respond to the ongoing demands of this crisis if we are stretched in too many different directions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><sup>2</sup>Empathy is a term that has been overused in design, but it is a term which has never been more relevant when used in its truest sense. Empty empathy when used in a purely semantic sense is worse than none. True empathy is about taking time to think deeply about the path as it is travelled by others. For more on this, I highly recommend reading the designer, <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://indiyoung.com/pubs-apps/"" target=""_blank"">Indi Young's writing</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>This post is a personal reflection in response to a question posed by <a href=""https://twitter.com/TomEduTrainer"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Tom Langston</a> on Twitter as a retweet of <a href=""https://twitter.com/CleggDr"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr Andy Clegg</a>. Observing that other individuals tagged in the tweet have more involvement in policy and management, I was both humbled and interested in why my opinion might be sought. Deliberately I have chosen not to read the answers of others, such as <a href=""https://twitter.com/jamesclay"">@jamesclay</a>'s <a href=""https://elearningstuff.net/2020/06/05/what-have-we-learnt/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">blog post</a>, as I wanted to provide my own perspective. I shall be sure to read that after-the-fact of course and thank you for asking Tom!</p>
<p>To provide some context I have been working as a learning technologist for almost 10 years and my perspective comes from that space: the direct solution space. Although I am occasionally consulted on policy decisions, I am rarely a decision maker and I do not manage people, I do manage systems as a product owner of sorts. In addition to my learning technologist 'hat', I am an accessibility advocate and a trained User Experience researcher. I am passionate about inclusive design, moral transparency and pragmatic teaching and learning.</p>

<h2>Entering lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it became clear that lockdown would be our new reality; decisions had to be made and actioned rapidly. It also became clear that learning technology expertise was a valuable commodity. As a discipline we were suddenly placed at the centre of supporting the continuation of teaching practice, as opposed to our previous position as the grand adviser-integrator-augmenters. I praise my own managers during the lead-up to and final situation of lockdown, who made quick and clear decisions with regard to which tools would be used, and for what tasks in the emergency teaching situation.</p>

<h2>The Corridor Effect™️</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Corridor Effect™️ may not be the final title of this phenomena, I am still considering it, because really it is about the lack of corridors. Think about how much information we glean from colleagues in corridors, how those encounters build social cohesion and provide other perspectives and most importantly differing interpretations of information. Right now we are all in our own bubbles and this can profoundly affect some students who find locating and prioritising information difficult. They may have relied on the organisation and perception of others to stay up-to-date before. That is no longer an option, unless we build in these opportunities. Discussion boards, encouragement of study groups, specific support groups for some students; all of these approaches and more can be used and must be used. The consequence of not doing so means that the gap between those who understand the rules of academic game and those who are still learning how to play will exponentially grow.</p>

<h3>Teaching with empathy<sup><a href=""#empathy"">2</a></sup></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that as educators, now more than ever we need to think deeply about the experience of engaging with learning as a journey. For us, we may have travelled this particular learning path many times; we may have taught the same content over successive iterations of a course/module. For the students it is most likely their first time and add to that the current personal, professional and societal challenges and undoubtedly this is a big ask. I have seen some amazing examples of empathetic, yet rigorous, teaching over the past few months and despite the challenges currently facing Higher Education internationally, this gives me hope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This post is an unabashed summary of my ideas, perhaps fledging ideas, and I do not doubt that these ideas have surfaced elsewhere in educational theory. However, I feel that sometimes writing from experience and considering how something exists and feels at a given time is a valuable endeavour and I plan to test and revisit these notions in the months-to-come. Thank you for reading.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"" target=""_blank"">Agile</a> is not a panacea, it is imperfect. However, I have had a glimpse of a new world of productivity and personally believe that problems should be viewed as a dataset rather than our raison d'etre as a profession. We will not be able to respond to the ongoing demands of this crisis if we are stretched in too many different directions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><sup>2</sup>Empathy is a term that has been overused in design, but it is a term which has never been more relevant when used in its truest sense. Empty empathy when used in a purely semantic sense is worse than none. True empathy is about taking time to think deeply about the path as it is travelled by others. For more on this, I highly recommend reading the designer, <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://indiyoung.com/pubs-apps/"" target=""_blank"">Indi Young's writing</a>.</p>

1102,1,08/08/2020 23:07,08/08/2020 22:07,"In February I shall be starting an MSc in User Experience Design and as a consequence my thoughts have turned to the study tools, which I wish to make use of as a student. As part of this process I have been considering my arsenal of apps. I'll likely talk about the full extent of my app choice plotting in future posts. In this post I shall provide my reflections on notetaking apps in-particular. In my experience early preparation has always been the best strategy when considering any new academic venture, so I look forward to sharing some of my findings on this blog in the lead up to and during my forthcoming period of study.
In my professional life I have become a devotee of <a title=""Evernote website"" href=""https://evernote.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Evernote</a>. I was not by any means an early adopter or rather I was but I got burned by a glitch circa 2009 which resulted in the loss on my web-based notes (at that time using it in-browser). I must stress that such a loss is not likely to happen with Evernote now but back then it was a relatively new thing and when on the cutting edge you may occasionally experience virtual paper cuts (thankfully I only lost a few notes)! However last year Evernote won my heart again when I decided that I wanted a solution with note tagging (keywords), multi-platform compatibility (in my case, Mac, PC, iOS, Android) and OCR capabilities (text recognition). After looking at a few app-based solutions it was the only option which gave me the flexibility I was craving.
In my work I have come to rely on Evernote as an excellent option for recording meetings and consultations, being able to send a record of what was discussed and any actions to a staff person immediately after the meeting. I then link this information to my to-dos in <a title=""Trello website"" href=""https://trello.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Trello</a> (I'll write about the wonders of Trello some other time). Sometimes when I'm particularly busy I quickly jot ideas or tasks down on paper and then use Evernote's document capture function to take a photo. I am always impressed by the OCR capabilities of Evernote when it comes to recognising my squiggly handwriting and making it searchable (the detects words in handwriting rather than converting handwriting to type). Also when you add in the photo annotation tools made possible through Evenote's partner app <a title=""Skitch App"" href=""https://evernote.com/skitch/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Skitch</a> I am one happy customer.
But...and you knew that this was coming, there is something to be said for handwriting and when it comes to deeper notetaking and truly learning concepts; I personally need to write concepts down to retain and understand them. When the iPad first came out in 2010 (Apple, 2010) I was an early adopter and one of the first apps I fell in love with was <a title=""Penultimate app site"" href=""https://evernote.com/penultimate/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Penultimate</a>. This app lets you draw or write with a stylus or your finger in virtual notebooks, later they added being able to add photos and voila it became a virtual sketchbook! I no longer wanted to carry a moleskin and an iPad and for a while Penultimate served me well for quick notetaking. Penultimate was acquired by Evernote in 2012 (Libin, 2012) and with that came the OCR capability of being able to 'search' your handwritten notes. However there were three functions which I have always felt are missing from Penultimate app which eventually caused me to abandon it. The first is the absence of a adequate notebook file management system, in apps like <a title=""Goodreader site"" href=""http://www.goodiware.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodreader</a>, <a title=""iAnnotatePDF site"" href=""http://www.branchfire.com/iannotate/#makepaperjealous"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">iAnnotatePDF</a> and <a title=""Notability site - Gingerlabs"" href=""http://www.gingerlabs.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Notability</a>, although more strictly for annotation of imported files, these apps allowed a far superior filing system. For example in iAnnotatePDF you can tag files with keywords, create folders and connect to Sharepoint (MyFiles) via WebDAV for backup purposes. In Penultimate, you just have an ever growing pile of notebooks.

[caption id=""attachment_75"" align=""alignnone"" width=""550""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/filemanagementiAnnotatePDF-2dgm3on.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class="" wp-image-75"" title=""File Management in iAnnotatePDF"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/filemanagementiAnnotatePDF-2dgm3on-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""filemanagementiAnnotatePDF"" width=""550"" height=""412""></a> File Management in iAnnotatePDF - showing the tagging function in practise[/caption]

The second issue is the background colour, from my <a title=""The Adjustment Bureau: The Case for Adjustment in Mobile Apps"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2014/09/07/the-adjustment-bureau/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">previous post</a> you'll know that background colour is very important to my efficiency when reading and writing. You do have the option of importing a photo to use as a background, so in theory that is a workaround and you can purchase notepaper types from Evernote Market, there are some good ones but these are more to do with line based layouts than page background colour. I have also found this <a title=""iPadPapers site"" href=""http://ipadpapers.com/tag.asp?tag=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">enterprising site</a> which allows you to create your own templates for Penultimate as well as use templates which other's have created, in particular I was happy to find a <a title=""Cornell PDF tutorial"" href=""http://lsc.cornell.edu/LSC_Resources/cornellsystem.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Cornell Notes format</a> template after the recent <a title=""MELSIG event page"" href=""http://melsig.shu.ac.uk/?page_id=645"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MELSIG</a> presentation about it. With any drawing/handwriting app, as a workaround, you could draw a template on the page, but then it becomes tricky when you need to cut and paste your written sections as the background gets confused with your written content.

[caption id=""attachment_77"" align=""alignnone"" width=""550""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NotesPlus_Backgroundcolours-2k8wz3p.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""size-large wp-image-77"" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NotesPlus_Backgroundcolours-2k8wz3p-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""Notes Plus"" width=""550"" height=""412""></a> Notes Plus - the myriad of background colour and template options available in Notes Plus.[/caption]

The third issue is the lack of an adjustable on-screen wrist protector. Penultimate allows you to define your wrist position but as you will see from the image below, it has trouble deciding which marks my stylus is making and which marks my wrist is making. This was the deal-breaker, I'd be mid-flow in writing and half of what I'd written would fail to show up as in Penultimate's view my wrist had been doing the writing!

[caption id=""attachment_76"" align=""alignnone"" width=""385""]<a href=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/penultimate_wrist-183un00.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class="" wp-image-76 "" src=""http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/penultimate_wrist-183un00-768x1024.jpg"" alt=""penultimate"" width=""385"" height=""513""></a> Penultimate - the effect of wrist shown. Also shown the excellent Cornell Notes template from <a title=""iPadPapers.com"" href=""http://ipadpapers.com/tag.asp?tag=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">iPadPapers.com</a>[/caption]

So after four years of on and off trial and error, with periodic abandonment of the idea of handwriting on my iPad other than using very helpful PDF annotation apps for small comments (another post about these apps specifically in the future), I think that I have finally come up with my ideal list of functions which a handwriting app needs - and one app fits almost all of them - Notes Plus with Notability taking a close second place.
<strong>My ideal list of functions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>File management</strong> and ideally creation of folders or notebooks for storage of different note types</li>
 	<li><strong>Background page colour</strong> and template adjustment</li>
 	<li>Adjustable <strong><strong>on-screen wristguard
</strong></strong>

<strong>Conclusions:</strong>
For written notes Notes Plus wins hands-down and it is also superb for combining PDFs, Word documents and written notes into self-contained notebooks or virtual binders. I have resolved to use it for the purpose of textbook related notes over the next few months. I'll report back on how it goes.
For decent notetaking and excellent PDF annotation Notability has clear benefits.
iAnnotatePDF's clear advantage over the other apps is its excellent file management &nbsp;system and also the ability to place audio comments in context within a document.

I personally find the following definition from <a title=""Jisc website"" href=""https://www.jisc.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jisc</a> to be the most helpful:
<blockquote>
<p class=""page-title"">Open educational resources are teaching and learning materials that are freely available online for everyone to use, whether you are an instructor, student or self-learner. Examples of OER include: full courses, course modules, syllabi, lectures, homework assignments, quizzes, lab and classroom activities, pedagogical materials, games, simulations, and many more resources contained in digital media collections from around the world.
Jisc, from ""Open educational resources (OERs)"" (<a title=""OER definition"" href=""https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/open-educational-resources"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">direct link</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""page-title"">So the point is that an OER can be almost anything, what distinguishes it is the fact that it is an openly available resource. In the interest of being more specific, from this point forth I shall refer to what I am designing as a learning object; a self-contained learning exercise, which in this case is delivered online from a designated server space or Learning Object repository. This Learning Object will be a basic web application with a ""choose your own adventure"" type learning exercise based on the creation and format of study materials with some interactive gamification elements thrown in. A lot more thinking and development will be required before we can get to that point.</p>
My imagined client for this project is a UK university (enrollment = 20K+) and the intended audience for the Learning Object are their academic staff. The university would like the Learning Object to be openly accessible as it is a mode of publicity (shared via social networks with university branding) and it shows that the university are forward thinking and considering staff professional development and digital capabilities. As the link to the resource will be openly accessible and find-able via search engines, this means that potential users could be anyone with an interest in the accessible presentation of resources, for example: primary school teachers, lecturers, student support tutors, learning technologists, students in teaching training, etc. Potential users could also be anyone who works with a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) or a Learning Management System (LMS) and there are many flavours VLE/LMS on the market. Furthermore users may also come from anywhere in the world, which means that if I wanted to serve all potential users the Learning Object (LO) would need to be available in multiple languages.
The unique paradigm presented by OERs is explained very nicely via metaphor from Jisc - interestingly Jisc also use the consumer and creator definitions, although I came up my definitions independently and found their page after the fact: https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/open-educational-resources/oer-myths

<h2>Hold-up...this is getting really complicated</h2>
However that is not the model that I am going for in this case, the LO is not meant to be all things, to all people; it is for a very specific purpose and that is to help academic staff at a university in the UK gain awareness of different strategies for making learning materials accessible as a response to the forthcoming <a title=""Changes to DSA"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/higher-education-student-support-changes-to-disabled-students-allowances-dsa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">changes to Disabilities Living Allowance</a>. These changes, planned by the current government will take effect halfway through 2016 and may affect the support provisions available to some students in the UK. This LO serves a specific need, for a specific client so is to a certain extent propriatary, the way that we achieve the ""open"" aspect is make the URL accessible to external users outside the university; use metadata to support search engine optimisation; license the underlying code with a <a title=""GNU General Public License 3 info"" href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GNU General Public License 3</a>; and make the source code available via a repository like <a title=""GNA website"" href=""http://gna.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">gna.org</a> which is hosted in France and supports <a title=""Git Version Control"" href=""http://www.git-scm.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">git version control</a> (to comply with <a title=""EU Safe Habour"" href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34442618"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">EU safe harbour ruling</a>).
<h2>On the topic of technical construction...</h2>
Upon consideration of how the Learning Object will be created, I think that it will be a custom coded html5 site with MySQL backing (this is subject to change). A facet of the brief is that data needs to be entered by the user in some way, web applications like <a title=""Xerte"" href=""http://www.xerte.org.uk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Xerte</a> which allow for the fast creation of html5 Learning Objects are not suitable as the resulting LOs seem to be read-only. So although these LOs can be interactive, no data that is entered is actually collected thus the need for a custom solution rather than using an established LO creator application. As the plan is to make the source code publicly reusable this will need to be considered during the construction process, to ensure that there is sufficient documentation to guide those who may wish to reuse the code.
In this model there are two key user groups:
<ul>
 	<li>those users from the university who interact with the LO;</li>
 	<li>those users from outside the university who interact with the LO.</li>
</ul>
We also need to consider:
<ul>
 	<li>those external users who consume first and then move on to create; as in copy and adapt the LO using the source code. These user-creators fall outside the scope of the design for interaction, but should be considered throughout the design and coding stages to ensure that documentation for the code is sufficient and the design allows for future customisation. For example clear image tags and labeling need to be in place to allow any screenshots taken from Moodle or a different VLE to be substituted for the original screenshots taken from Blackboard (see paragraph below).</li>
</ul>
As I mentioned before there are many different VLEs out there, however as we are talking about the UK (and anyone else is welcome to go to town with the content) then the two most prevalent VLEs in the UK are Blackboard and Moodle (UCISA, 2014, p.10). As a consequence, those users who <em>consume</em> will fall into two camps - those with an interest in Blackboard and those with an interest in Moodle; the principles presented in the Learning Object will be the same for each system but the visual aesthetics differ between the two. My client is a university that uses Blackboard, so the LO will be blackboard focused but we hope that someone will create Moodle and other versions in the future based on our source code.

<hr />

<h2>Friday, 6th of November 2015 - Update:</h2>
I have changed my thinking on the LO, as VLEs are updated fairly often this would limit the shelf-life of the LO. It was also proving to be too complex. So I have decided to focus on the idea that I am building one LO, of a hypothetical many, and the LOs are all about the different kind of materials going into the VLE. The LO I am designing will be about creating accessible documents in Microsoft Word. For more on this, see <a title=""Making a game of task decomposition – just in time for Halloween"" href=""http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog-archive/2015/10/29/making-a-game-of-task-decomposition-just-in-time-for-halloween/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this later post</a>.

<td rowspan=""3""><strong>Direct</strong></td>
<td><strong>Users from the university: academic staff</strong></td>
<td>The design needs to be approachable with goals for the LO clearly outlined. It is quite important that users do not need to login in order to use the LO. A sort of login fatigue is a major issue and some university users may wish to remain anonymous.</td>
<td>It would be helpful to track how many academic staff complete the LO, so a potential method for this would be allow the production of a completion certificate at the end of the LO, this will only be generated after the user logs in (using an existing university LDAP easy proxy). Users will have the option to skip the certificate, if they wish to remain anonymous. External users and anon users will still be able to generate a basic completion certificate, but it won't have full university validation (or something along those lines).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Users from the university: students, admin staff, researchers etc.</strong></td>
<td>Although the intended audience are the academic staff at the university and the LO will be clearly labelled as such, other types of university users will not be prevented from accessing the LO.</td>
<td>At the beginning of the LO the users will be asked to type in their role which will auto-populate an entry cell based on a predefined set of options. E.g. What is your role? I am... offer a drop-down list (e.g. a student; a researcher, an administrator etc.) and autocomplete, if ""other"" is selected then they will be asked to specify. In order to gain some basic usage stats, users will be asked to self-identify whether they work/study at the client university (to differentiate between internal and external users). This data will not be completely accurate as people may forget to self-identify or an external user may incorrectly identify, however it will give an indication of use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Users external to the university</strong></td>
<td>External users will have access to the LO. These users could come from anywhere in the world and English may not be their first language.</td>
<td>As login is not required to use the LO, any entry fields must be validated to ensure that malicious code cannot be entered in the LO.
The option for a basic certificate, where the external users enter their preferred name and a PDF is generated for download needs to be available.
Write the LO in <a title=""plain english campaign"" href=""http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">plain English</a>, this will help all users.
Where specific technical terms are used, provide a glossary and/or rollover definitions as technical terms differ per country.</td>

<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Remote</strong></td>
<td>Technologist/s responsible for monitoring the use of the LO needs a way to download usage data. These users are also support users.</td>
<td>Require access to a basic online dashboard showing how many academic staff per department/school have completed the LO. Counts of other users should also be included in the dashboard and an option to download the data as a .csv.</td>
<td>It would be ideal for this data to be displayed as a leader board; a graph showing the top school through to the bottom school. However this is really out-of-scope, as that is a separate application. It would be nice to show users school stats after they have logged in for their certificate. E.g. you are 1 of 48 people in Computing who have completed the LO. Computing is now the 2nd most engaged school. However if robust .csv export features are added visualisations could be produced periodically in Excel and other programs and the leader board could be added at a later stage.
Any more complex anonymous data about visitors to the LO should be reviewed through Google Analytics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Collateral</strong></td>
<td>Those accessing derivative versions of the LO via  third-party repositories.</td>
<td>The LO may loose some value in its iterations and therefore when it is placed in repositories by third-parties, the owners of these repositories may not want it to be there.
The client university's branding graphics will not be included with the source code, as it needs to be clear that derivatives are not still owned/maintained by the university.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Prohibited</strong></td>
<td>Someone who wishes to inject malicious code into the LO in order to target users.</td>
<td>Validate all data entered into the LO according to set parameters; disallow html tags and certain words/characters.
There is little that the university can do to prevent this in the derivative versions of the LO, but a disclaimer should be included in the source code stating that the LO should only be used when delivered/served by reputable providers.</td>

<td><strong>Support</strong></td>
<td>Technologist/s (employee/s of the university) who support and maintain the system. These folks are also direct users and</td>
<td>This knowledge and level of access will also be shared with employees of the university. They require documentation/training prior to providing access.
As the original creator, of the LO we/I will have a level of involvement in it's continued maintenance, updating the code for an agreed time period.</td>

Recently I was asked to present at the Media-Enhanced Learning Special Interest Group (MELSIG) event hosted by the University of Sussex. MELSIG is a special interest group originally formed in 2008 (MELSIG, 2014). The group's focus has evolved, alongside contemporary developments in technology, to include investigation of a wide variety of digital media when applied to the support of learning and teaching. The theme for the University of Sussex event was <em>Digital Media Interaction and Inclusivity</em> and this was exactly the prompt I needed to engage in more thorough research of in-app adjustment functions which has been preoccupation of mine for a while.

Through my work building 'communities of practice' (Wenger, 1998) on both sides of the Atlantic, and in particular during the development of <a title=""DIY – Build Your Own App Swap Events"" href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearning/the-team/case-studies/diy-build-your-own-app-swap-breakfasts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>App Swap</em> </a>events at the University of Brighton something always bothered me about apps or mobile applications/software. Namely why, when developers have such rich <a title=""Software Development Kit"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SDKs</a> to work with, isn't there more attention to paid to inclusivity when designing apps? Both the iOS and Android operating systems have a number of built-in functions which have the potential to greatly aid accessibility in addition to the benefits afforded by the touchscreens and the form factors of the devices themselves. However, due to the unique conditions under which apps are developed a combination of factors including time/monetary constraints, corporate interests and the lack of a common accessibility guidelines seem to stifle the potential of certain apps on the accessibility front. Indeed within app development no equivalent to the <a title=""WC3 WAI"" href=""http://www.w3.org/WAI/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WC3's Web Accessibility Initiative</a> seems to have emerged and the rule systems applied to website design such as the <a title=""EU Internet Handbook"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/standards/accessibility/index_en.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">EU Internet Handbook</a> have no bearing on the design of apps. On the one hand this is quite liberating for interface designers and has led to something of a <em>Wild West</em> populated by some truly innovative interface designs.

My intention with this post, I should point out, is not to stifle innovation, but rather I would like to propose that when an app's primary purpose falls within certain categories of use, 'categories' which can be applied to the creation or consumption of educational materials or be used in support of learning, that extra attention be paid to the accessibility features of 'said' apps. Perhaps in the future this could resemble a set of agreed standards, but at this time I would like to make more of a humble request rather than a full recommendation. The core idea I put forth in relation to my 'request' is the notion of letting the user choose and customise the app through the presence of 'adjustment'; this I believe is a key facet of the path to accessibility. I shall expand on 'categories of use' later in this post.

A personal experience which prompted this line of enquiry was my use of Amazon's Kindle app for iPad. In October 2011 Apple introduced support of text-to-speech (TTS) within their iOS5 operating system (Moren, D. 2012); as a Dyslexic person I was eager to make use of this function and to this day find it immensely useful. Imagine my disappointment to find out that the 'Speak Selection' tool is actively blocked within the Kindle app. The 'VoiceOver' tool was later allowed within the Kindle for iPad app (Ingber, J. 2013) and Amazon had introduced its own text-to-speech function to the Kindle 2 device in 2009 but eBook publishers could choose to disallow the function with the viewpoint that it might damage audiobook sales (Schofield, J. 2009). There is another aspect of the Kindle app which always seems a bit of an oversight; reading background colours. Given the development resources available to Amazon, there are only three options provided for the text background colour: White, Black (X-Ray) and Sepia. Why not make the reading experience as accessible as possible by including customisable background colours as evidenced by apps like <a title=""bluefire reader developer site"" href=""http://www.bluefirereader.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bluefire Reader</a>, <a title=""Kobo Reader apps"" href=""http://www.kobo.com/apps"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kobo Reader</a> and <a title=""Goodreader developer site"" href=""http://www.goodiware.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodreader</a>? When comparing Kindle to particularly Kobo reader and Goodreader one is reminded of the oft used technological paradigm of VHS and Betamax; VHS won due to market share in combination with other factors rather than viewing quality.

On the topic of background colour more specifically, from a personal perspective this is the number one 'adjustment' which I would like to see made available in apps. Particularly those apps which are promoted as 'readers'. My own perception of black text on a white background has been a persistent barrier to my consumption and enjoyment of reading. To help elaborate on my own experience I even created <a title=""dylexic irlen sketch"" href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a javascript web application</a> (using <a title=""processing.org"" href=""http://processing.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Processing</a>) to show what this experience is like for me. This is a condition sometimes known as Irlen Syndrome, Meres-Irlen Syndrome, Visual Stress or Scoptopic Sensitivity syndrome. I am hesitant to adopt any of these definitions as an explanation of my experience, as I have never received an official diagnosis. Furthermore there are some sceptical viewpoints in the medical fields when assessing the diagnostic procedures and the original studies which led to the recognition of the symptoms (Coyle, B. 1995 and Lawrence, J. 2008). I prefer to view it as a complex part of my own dyslexic puzzle and one thing is not in doubt, the ability to adjust background colours, fonts and font-sizes makes a huge difference to my experience of reading.
So why the title of <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>? The 2011 film, <em>The Adjustment Bureau </em>based on the Phillip K. Dick's short story, <em>The Adjustment Team</em> (1954 - <a title=""full text source"" href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adjustment_Team"">full text</a>) which tells of characters whose life choices deviate from a preordained plan set-out by a mysterious organisation. Inspired by this idea I postulated that there may be a parallel between that concept and app developers whose choices are guided or pushed by a combination of external factors and client influences, ultimately I wondered whether this explains why the avenues to accessibility are so seldom followed? With all of this in mind I decided to enter into an assessment of the adjustment functionality available within some of the most prominent and popular apps I have encountered while working in Higher Education. I focused on apps available for iOS for this pursuit as that is the primary device type supported in my workplace and I had access to the devices. This also prompted me to define some basic 'categories of use' when applied to app use within academia for the support of learning and teaching.

The <strong>Categories of Use</strong> are as follows:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Category</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Browser</td>
<td>A web browser for navigating web-based information. May include other features such as reader functions and RSS curation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Composer</td>
<td>In this context for the composition of text-based materials and documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consumer</td>
<td>For curation and consumption of RSS content, blogs and online news sources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Notetaker/annotation</td>
<td>Apps with the main purpose of taking notes and/or placing notes and annotation on documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reader</td>
<td>Apps with the primary purpose of reading text, eBooks, ePubs, PDF and other text formats. May have limited annotation tools.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
When defining the categories I tried to resist the use of pre-existing desktop software definitions such as for example '<em>word processing'. </em>These definitions have established associations and many apps reach beyond the format-based outputs which are expected from these former software definitions.
The <strong>Adjustment </strong><strong>Criteria</strong> upon which each app was judged are listed below. If an app includes a feature it is awarded a point for that criterion, it may partially allow a feature which would result in a 0.5 of a point. The total score is a point value out of a total of 8, for the 8 criteria and is shown as a final percentage. Apps which achieve &gt;=60% are highlighted in purple.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Criterion</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>

<tr>
<td>Font Size</td>
<td>Font size can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>

<td>Line Height</td>
<td>Line height can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sepia</td>
<td>A sepia background (beige/mild yellow) is a specific option within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sliders/Colour</td>
<td>A selection of colours or Red/Green/Blue sliders allow the user to adjust and specify the background colour within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pinch zoom</td>
<td>The pinch zoom is a built-in function of the iOS. Some apps do not make/allow full use of this touch-based function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS Speak Selection</td>
<td>A function which can be enabled in the General &gt; Accessibility functions in the iOS this can be used by selecting text in certain apps and pressing the 'speak' option which comes up. This is distinct from the 'Voiceover' option which is a complete audio interface and harder use for quick impromptu needs.</td>
</tr>

The scores as an embedded Google Spreadsheet - a work in progress. NB: this list is not designed to be exhaustive and if you have other apps which you would like me to assess using these criteria, please add them to the comments area below. The ""+"" next to the app title identifies that the app is available for both iPhone and iPad.

<strong>Conclusion
</strong>Through this process of investigation and app functionality testing I feel that I have only begun to scrape the surface of how accessibility functions are implemented and the possible avenues for improvement. I think that there is certainly scope to devise a more concrete scoring and testing system with the view to helping teachers and learners make informed decisions about the accessibility functions of certain apps. Such a system would also have the potential to help inform developers about the needs of specific user groups. However the responsibility cannot be squarely that of the developers, as users we also have a responsibility to let developers know what we want and need. One of the benefits of working with apps is that developers are often small to medium sized companies and really benefit from the suggestions from their user-base, this may extend to use testing. In the <em>Wild West</em> of apps we as the user have an opportunity to make a difference and we shouldn't miss out by sticking to the easy path.

Recently I was asked to present at the Media-Enhanced Learning Special Interest Group (MELSIG) event hosted by the University of Sussex. MELSIG is a special interest group originally formed in 2008 (MELSIG, 2014). The group's focus has evolved, alongside contemporary developments in technology, to include investigation of a wide variety of digital media when applied to the support of learning and teaching. The theme for the University of Sussex event was <em>Digital Media Interaction and Inclusivity</em> and this was exactly the prompt I needed to engage in more thorough research of in-app adjustment functions which has been preoccupation of mine for a while.

Through my work building 'communities of practice' (Wenger, 1998) on both sides of the Atlantic, and in particular during the development of <a title=""DIY – Build Your Own App Swap Events"" href=""http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/elearning/the-team/case-studies/diy-build-your-own-app-swap-breakfasts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>App Swap</em> </a>events at the University of Brighton something always bothered me about apps or mobile applications/software. Namely why, when developers have such rich <a title=""Software Development Kit"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SDKs</a> to work with, isn't there more attention to paid to inclusivity when designing apps? Both the iOS and Android operating systems have a number of built-in functions which have the potential to greatly aid accessibility in addition to the benefits afforded by the touchscreens and the form factors of the devices themselves. However, due to the unique conditions under which apps are developed a combination of factors including time/monetary constraints, corporate interests and the lack of a common accessibility guidelines seem to stifle the potential of certain apps on the accessibility front. Indeed within app development no equivalent to the <a title=""WC3 WAI"" href=""http://www.w3.org/WAI/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WC3's Web Accessibility Initiative</a> seems to have emerged and the rule systems applied to website design such as the <a title=""EU Internet Handbook"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/standards/accessibility/index_en.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">EU Internet Handbook</a> have no bearing on the design of apps. On the one hand this is quite liberating for interface designers and has led to something of a <em>Wild West</em> populated by some truly innovative interface designs.
My intention with this post, I should point out, is not to stifle innovation, but rather I would like to propose that when an app's primary purpose falls within certain categories of use, 'categories' which can be applied to the creation or consumption of educational materials or be used in support of learning, that extra attention be paid to the accessibility features of 'said' apps. Perhaps in the future this could resemble a set of agreed standards, but at this time I would like to make more of a humble request rather than a full recommendation. The core idea I put forth in relation to my 'request' is the notion of letting the user choose and customise the app through the presence of 'adjustment'; this I believe is a key facet of the path to accessibility. I shall expand on 'categories of use' later in this post.
A personal experience which prompted this line of enquiry was my use of Amazon's Kindle app for iPad. In October 2011 Apple introduced support of text-to-speech (TTS) within their iOS5 operating system (Moren, D. 2012); as a Dyslexic person I was eager to make use of this function and to this day find it immensely useful. Imagine my disappointment to find out that the 'Speak Selection' tool is actively blocked within the Kindle app. The 'VoiceOver' tool was later allowed within the Kindle for iPad app (Ingber, J. 2013) and Amazon had introduced its own text-to-speech function to the Kindle 2 device in 2009 but eBook publishers could choose to disallow the function with the viewpoint that it might damage audiobook sales (Schofield, J. 2009). There is another aspect of the Kindle app which always seems a bit of an oversight; reading background colours. Given the development resources available to Amazon, there are only three options provided for the text background colour: White, Black (X-Ray) and Sepia. Why not make the reading experience as accessible as possible by including customisable background colours as evidenced by apps like <a title=""bluefire reader developer site"" href=""http://www.bluefirereader.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bluefire Reader</a>, <a title=""Kobo Reader apps"" href=""http://www.kobo.com/apps"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kobo Reader</a> and <a title=""Goodreader developer site"" href=""http://www.goodiware.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodreader</a>? When comparing Kindle to particularly Kobo reader and Goodreader one is reminded of the oft used technological paradigm of VHS and Betamax; VHS won due to market share in combination with other factors rather than viewing quality.
On the topic of background colour more specifically, from a personal perspective this is the number one 'adjustment' which I would like to see made available in apps. Particularly those apps which are promoted as 'readers'. My own perception of black text on a white background has been a persistent barrier to my consumption and enjoyment of reading. To help elaborate on my own experience I even created <a title=""dylexic irlen sketch"" href=""http://two-artists.com/Fiona_MacNeill/dyslexic-irlen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a javascript web application</a> (using <a title=""processing.org"" href=""http://processing.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Processing</a>) to show what this experience is like for me. This is a condition sometimes known as Irlen Syndrome, Meres-Irlen Syndrome, Visual Stress or Scoptopic Sensitivity syndrome. I am hesitant to adopt any of these definitions as an explanation of my experience, as I have never received an official diagnosis. Furthermore there are some sceptical viewpoints in the medical fields when assessing the diagnostic procedures and the original studies which led to the recognition of the symptoms (Coyle, B. 1995 and Lawrence, J. 2008). I prefer to view it as a complex part of my own dyslexic puzzle and one thing is not in doubt, the ability to adjust background colours, fonts and font-sizes makes a huge difference to my experience of reading.
So why the title of <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>? The 2011 film, <em>The Adjustment Bureau&nbsp;</em>based on the Phillip K. Dick's short story, <em>The Adjustment Team</em> (1954 - <a title=""full text source"" href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adjustment_Team"">full text</a>) which tells of characters whose life choices deviate from a preordained plan set-out by a mysterious organisation. Inspired by this idea I postulated that there may be a parallel between that concept and app developers whose choices are guided or pushed by a combination of external factors and client influences, ultimately I wondered whether this explains why the avenues to accessibility are so seldom followed? With all of this in mind I decided to enter into an assessment of the adjustment functionality available within some of the most prominent and popular apps I have encountered while working in Higher Education. I focused on apps available for iOS for this pursuit as that is the primary device type supported in my workplace and I had access to the devices. This also prompted me to define some basic 'categories of use' when applied to app use within academia for the support of learning and teaching.
The <strong>Categories of Use</strong> are as follows:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Category</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Browser</td>
<td>A web browser for navigating web-based information. May include other features such as reader functions and RSS curation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Composer</td>
<td>In this context for the composition of text-based materials and documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consumer</td>
<td>For curation and consumption of RSS content, blogs and online news sources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Notetaker/annotation</td>
<td>Apps with the main purpose of taking notes and/or placing notes and annotation on documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reader</td>
<td>Apps with the primary purpose of reading text, eBooks, ePubs, PDF and other text formats. May have limited annotation tools.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
When defining the categories I tried to resist the use of pre-existing desktop software definitions such as for example '<em>word processing'. </em>These definitions have established associations and many apps reach beyond the format-based outputs which are expected from these former software definitions.
The <strong>Adjustment </strong><strong>Criteria</strong> upon which each app was judged are listed below. If an app includes a feature it is awarded a point for that criterion, it may partially allow a feature which would result in a 0.5 of a point. The total score is a point value out of a total of 8, for the 8 criteria and is shown as a final percentage. Apps which achieve &gt;=60% are highlighted in purple.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Criterion</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Font Size</td>
<td>Font size can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Line Height</td>
<td>Line height can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Font Style</td>
<td>Font style can be changed specifically, within the app. In the case of 'composer' categorised apps this is included in their writing functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Invert/Brightness</td>
<td>Brightness of the display or invert (white text on black background) is a specific option within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sepia</td>
<td>A sepia background (beige/mild yellow) is a specific option within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background Colour: Sliders/Colour</td>
<td>A selection of colours or Red/Green/Blue sliders allow the user to adjust and specify the background colour within the app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pinch zoom</td>
<td>The pinch zoom is a built-in function of the iOS. Some apps do not make/allow full use of this touch-based function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS Speak Selection</td>
<td>A function which can be enabled in the General &gt; Accessibility functions in the iOS this can be used by selecting text in certain apps and pressing the 'speak' option which comes up. This is distinct from the 'Voiceover' option which is a complete audio interface and harder use for quick impromptu needs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The scores as an embedded Google Spreadsheet - a work in progress. NB: this list is not designed to be exhaustive and if you have other apps which you would like me to assess using these criteria, please add them to the comments area below. The ""+"" next to the app title identifies that the app is available for both iPhone and iPad.

<strong>Conclusion
</strong>Through this process of investigation and app functionality testing I feel that I have only begun to scrape the surface of how accessibility functions are implemented and the possible avenues for improvement. I think that there is certainly scope to devise a more concrete scoring and testing system with the view to helping teachers and learners make informed decisions about the accessibility functions of certain apps. Such a system would also have the potential to help inform developers about the needs of specific user groups. However the responsibility cannot be squarely that of the developers, as users we also have a responsibility to let developers know what we want and need. One of the benefits of working with apps is that developers are often small to medium sized companies and really benefit from the suggestions from their user-base, this may extend to use testing. In the <em>Wild West</em> of apps we as the user have an opportunity to make a difference and we shouldn't miss out by sticking to the easy path.
